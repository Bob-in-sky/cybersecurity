# Remediation

Microsoft has included patches to resolve this vulnerability in February’s “patch Tuesday” release. You can see a list of KB articles by Office build [here](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2024-21413). Updating Office through Windows Update or the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx) is strongly recommended.

Additionally, in the meantime, it is a timely reminder to practice general - safe - cyber security practices. For example, reminding users to:

- Do not click random links (especially from unsolicited emails)
- Preview links before clicking them
- Forward suspicious emails to the respective department responsible for cyber security

Since this vulnerability bypasses Outlook's Protected View, there is no way to reconfigure Outlook to prevent this attack. Additionally, preventing the <span style="color: inherit;">SMB</span> protocol entirely may do more harm than good, especially as it is essential for accessing network shares. However, you may be able to block this at the <span style="color: inherit;">firewall</span> level, depending on the organisation.
