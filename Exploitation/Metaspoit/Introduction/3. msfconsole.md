# msfconsole

The console will be your main interface to the <span style="color: inherit;">Metasploit</span> Framework. You can launch it using the `msfconsole` command on your terminal or any system the <span style="color: inherit;">Metasploit</span> Framework is installed on.

```shell

msf6 >
```

Once launched, you will see the command line change to msf6 (or msf5 depending on the installed version of <span style="color: inherit;">Metasploit</span>). The <span style="color: inherit;">Metasploit</span> console (msfconsole) can be used just like a regular command-line shell, as you can see below. The first command is `ls` which lists the contents of the folder from which <span style="color: inherit;">Metasploit</span> was launched using the `msfconsole` command.

It is followed by a `ping` sent to Google's <span style="color: inherit;">DNS</span> IP address (8.8.8.8). As we operate from <span style="color: inherit;">Linux</span> we had to add the `-c 1` option, so only a single ping was sent. Otherwise, the ping process would continue until it is stopped using `CTRL+C`.

```shell
msf6 > ls
[*] exec: ls

burpsuite_community_linux_v2021_8_1.sh	Instructions  Scripts
Desktop					Pictures      thinclient_drives
Downloads				Postman       Tools
msf6 > ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
[*] exec: ping -c 1 8.8.8.8

PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.335/1.335/1.335/0.000 ms
msf6 >
```

It will support most <span style="color: inherit;">Linux</span> commands, including `clear` (to clear the terminal screen), but will not allow you to use some features of a regular command line (e.g. does not support output redirection), as seen below.

```shell
msf6 > help > help.txt
[-] No such command
msf6 >
```

While on the subject, the help command can be used on its own or for a specific command. Below is the help menu for the set command we will cover soon.

```shell
msf6 > help set
Usage: set [option] [value]

Set the given option to value.  If value is omitted, print the current value.
If both are omitted, print options that are currently set.

If run from a module context, this will set the value in the module's
datastore.  Use -g to operate on the global datastore.

If setting a PAYLOAD, this command can take an index from `show payloads'.

msf6 >
```

You can use the history command to see commands you have typed earlier.

```shell
msf6 > history
1  use exploit/multi/http/nostromo_code_exec
2  set lhost 10.10.16.17
3  set rport 80
4  options
5  set rhosts 10.10.29.187
6  run
7  exit
8  exit -y
9  version
10  use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery
```

An important feature of msfconsole is the support of tab completion. This will come in handy later when using <span style="color: inherit;">Metasploit</span> commands or dealing with modules. For example, if you start typing `he` and press the tab key, you will see it auto-completes to `help`.

&nbsp;

Msfconsole is managed by context; this means that unless set as a global variable, all parameter settings will be lost if you change the module you have decided to use. In the example below, we have used the ms17_010_eternalblue exploit, and we have set parameters such as `RHOSTS`. If we were to switch to another module (e.g. a port scanner), we would need to set the RHOSTS value again as all changes we have made remained in the context of the ms17_010_eternalblue exploit.

Let us look at the example below to have a better understanding of this feature. We will use the MS17-010 “Eternalblue” exploit for illustration purposes.

Once you type the `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue` command, you will see the command line prompt change from msf6 to "msf6 exploit(windows/<span style="color: inherit;">smb</span>/ms17_010_eternalblue)". The "EternalBlue" is an exploit allegedly developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (N.S.A.) for a vulnerability affecting the SMBv1 server on numerous Windows systems. The <span style="color: inherit;">SMB</span> (Server Message Block) is widely used in Windows networks for file sharing and even for sending files to printers. EternalBlue was leaked by the cybercriminal group "Shadow Brokers" in April 2017. In May 2017, this vulnerability was exploited worldwide in the WannaCry ransomware attack.

```shell
msf6 > use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue 
[*] No payload configured, defaulting to windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) >
```

The module to be used can also be selected with the `use` command followed by the number at the beginning of the search result line.

While the prompt has changed, you will notice we can still run the commands previously mentioned. This means we did not "enter" a folder as you would typically expect in an operating system command line.

```shell
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > ls
[*] exec: ls

burpsuite_community_linux_v2021_8_1.sh	Instructions  Scripts
Desktop					Pictures      thinclient_drives
Downloads				Postman       Tools
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) >
```

The prompt tells us we now have a context set in which we will work. You can see this by typing the show options command.

```shell
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > show options

Module options (exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue):

   Name           Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----           ---------------  --------  -----------

   SMBDomain      .                no        (Optional) The Windows domain to use for authentication
   SMBPass                         no        (Optional) The password for the specified username
   SMBUser                         no        (Optional) The username to authenticate as
   VERIFY_ARCH    true             yes       Check if remote architecture matches exploit Target.
   VERIFY_TARGET  true             yes       Check if remote OS matches exploit Target.


Payload options (windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

```

This will print options related to the exploit we have chosen earlier. The show options command will have different outputs depending on the context it is used in. The example above shows that this exploit will require we set variables like RHOSTS and RPORT. On the other hand, a post-exploitation module may only need us to set a SESSION ID (see the code section below).

A session is an existing connection to the target system that the post-exploitation module will use.

```shell
msf6 post(windows/gather/enum_domain_users) > show options

Module options (post/windows/gather/enum_domain_users):

   Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
   HOST                      no        Target a specific host
   SESSION                   yes       The session to run this module on.
   USER                      no        Target User for NetSessionEnum

msf6 post(windows/gather/enum_domain_users) >
```

&nbsp;

The `show` command can be used in any context followed by a module type (auxiliary, payload, exploit, etc.) to list available modules. The example below lists payloads that can be used with the ms17-010 Eternalblue exploit.

```shell
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > show payloads

If used from the msfconsole prompt, the `show` command will list all modules.

The `use` and `show options` commands we have seen so far are identical for all modules in <span style="color: inherit;">Metasploit</span>.

You can leave the context using the `back` command.

```shell
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > back
msf6 > 
```

Further information on any module can be obtained by typing the `info` command within its context.

```shell

Payload information:
  Space: 2000

Description:
  This module is a port of the Equation Group ETERNALBLUE exploit, 
  part of the FuzzBunch toolkit released by Shadow Brokers. There is a 
  buffer overflow memmove operation in Srv!SrvOs2FeaToNt. The size is 
  calculated in Srv!SrvOs2FeaListSizeToNt, with mathematical error 
  where a DWORD is subtracted into a WORD. The kernel pool is groomed 
  so that overflow is well laid-out to overwrite an SMBv1 buffer. 
  Actual RIP hijack is later completed in 
  srvnet!SrvNetWskReceiveComplete. This exploit, like the original may 
  not trigger 100% of the time, and should be run continuously until 
  triggered. It seems like the pool will get hot streaks and need a 
  cool down period before the shells rain in again. The module will 
  attempt to use Anonymous login, by default, to authenticate to 
  perform the exploit. If the user supplies credentials in the 
  SMBUser, SMBPass, and SMBDomain options it will use those instead. 
  On some systems, this module may cause system instability and 
  crashes, such as a BSOD or a reboot. This may be more likely with 
  some payloads.

Alternatively, you can use the `info` command followed by the module’s path from the msfconsole prompt (e.g. `info exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`). Info is not a help menu; it will display detailed information on the module such as its author, relevant sources, etc.

&nbsp;

## search

One of the most useful commands in msfconsole is `search`. This command will search the Metasploit Framework database for modules relevant to the given search parameter. You can conduct searches using CVE numbers, exploit names (eternalblue, heartbleed, etc.), or target system.

```shell
msf6 > search ms17-010

The output of the `search` command provides an overview of each returned module. You may notice the “name” column already gives more information than just the module name. You can see the type of module (auxiliary, exploit, etc.) and the category of the module (scanner, admin, windows, Unix, etc.). You can use any module returned in a search result with the command use followed by the number at the beginning of the result line. (e.g. `use 0` instead of `use auxiliary/admin/smb/ms17_010_command`)

Another essential piece of information returned is in the “rank” column. Exploits are rated based on their reliability. The table below provides their respective descriptions.

| Ranking | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ExcellentRanking** | The exploit will never crash the service. This is the case for SQL Injection, CMD execution, RFI, LFI, etc. No typical memory corruption exploits should be given this ranking unless there are extraordinary circumstances ([WMF Escape()](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/windows/browser/ms06_001_wmf_setabortproc.rb)). |
| **GreatRanking** | The exploit has a default target AND either auto-detects the appropriate target or uses an application-specific return address AFTER a version check. |
| **GoodRanking** | The exploit has a default target and it is the “common case” for this type of software (English, Windows 7 for a desktop app, 2012 for server, etc). Exploit does not auto-detect the target. |
| **NormalRanking** | The exploit is otherwise reliable, but depends on a specific version that is not the “common case” for this type of software and can’t (or doesn’t) reliably autodetect. |
| **AverageRanking** | The exploit is generally unreliable or difficult to exploit, but has a success rate of 50% or more for common platforms. |
| **LowRanking** | The exploit is nearly impossible to exploit (under 50% success rate) for common platforms. |
| **ManualRanking** | The exploit is unstable or difficult to exploit and is basically a DoS (15% success rate or lower). This ranking is also used when the module has no use unless specifically configured by the user (e.g.: [exploit/unix/webapp/php_eval](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/unix/webapp/php_eval.rb)). |

&nbsp;

You can direct the search function using keywords such as type and platform.

For example, if we wanted our search results to only include auxiliary modules, we could set the type to auxiliary. The screenshot below shows the output of the search type:auxiliary telnet command.

```shell
msf6 > search type:auxiliary telnet

Please remember that exploits take advantage of a vulnerability on the target system and may always show unexpected behavior. A low-ranking exploit may work perfectly, and an excellent ranked exploit may not, or worse, crash the target system.
