# Cracking Password Protected Zip Files

We can use John to crack the password on password-protected Zip files.

&nbsp;

## zip2john

Similarly to the `unshadow` tool used previously, we will use the `zip2john` tool to convert the Zip file into a hash format that John can understand and hopefully crack. The primary usage is like this:

```code
zip2john [options] [zip file] > [output file]
```

- `[options]`: Allows you to pass specific checksum options to `zip2john`; this shouldn’t often be necessary
- `[zip file]`: The path to the Zip file you wish to get the hash of
- `>`: This redirects the output from this command to another file
- `[output file]`: This is the file that will store the output

### Example Usage

```code
zip2john zipfile.zip > zip_hash.txt
```

&nbsp;

## Cracking

We’re then able to take the file we output from `zip2john` in our example use case, `zip_hash.txt`, and, as we did with `unshadow`, feed it directly into John as we have made the input specifically for it.

```code
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt zip_hash.txt
```

# Exercises

Now, have a go at cracking a “secure” Zip file! The file is located in `~/John-the-Ripper-The-Basics/Task09/`.

### Question 1

What is the password for the secure.zip file?

### Question 2

What is the contents of the flag inside the zip file?

answer: <span style="color: #0e0e0e;">THM{w3ll_d0n3_h4sh_r0y4l}</span>
