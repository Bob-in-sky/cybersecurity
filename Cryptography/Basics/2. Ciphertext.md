# Ciphertext

Ciphertext is a scrambled version of plaintext that has been encrypted using a cipher algorithm. Ciphertext is unreadable without the correct decryption key. The process of communication transforms plaintext into ciphertext in order to hide the content of the messages being sent over the connection.

We begin with the plaintext that we want to encrypt. The plaintext is the readable data; it can be anything from a simple “hello”, a cat photo, credit card information, or medical health records. From a cryptography perspective, these are all “plaintext” messages waiting to be encrypted. The plaintext is passed through the encryption function along with a proper key; the encryption function returns a ciphertext. The encryption function is part of the cipher; a cipher is an algorithm to convert a plaintext into a ciphertext and vice versa.

To recover the plaintext, the ciphertext must be accompanied with the proper key via the decryption function, which would give the original plaintext back.

- **Plaintext** is the original, readable message or data before it’s encrypted. It can be a document, an image, a multimedia file, or any other binary data.
- **Ciphertext** is the scrambled, unreadable version of the message after encryption. Ideally, we cannot get any information about the original plaintext except its approximate size.
- **Cipher** is an algorithm or method to convert plaintext into ciphertext and back again. A cipher is usually developed by a mathematician.
- **Key** is a string of bits the cipher uses to encrypt or decrypt data. In general, the used cipher is public knowledge; however, the key must remain secret unless it is the public key in asymmetric encryption.
- **Encryption** is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using a cipher and a key. Unlike the key, the choice of the cipher is disclosed.
- **Decryption** is the reverse process of encryption, converting ciphertext back into plaintext using a cipher and a key. Although the cipher would be public knowledge, recovering the plaintext without knowledge of the key should be impossible (infeasible).
