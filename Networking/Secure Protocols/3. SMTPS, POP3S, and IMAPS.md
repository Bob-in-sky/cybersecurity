# SMTPS, POP3S, and IMAPS

Adding TLS to <span style="color: inherit;">SMTP</span>, POP3, and <span style="color: inherit;">IMAP</span> is no different than adding TLS to <span style="color: inherit;">HTTP</span>. Similar to how <span style="color: inherit;">HTTP</span> gets an appended S for *Secure* and becomes HTTPS; <span style="color: inherit;">SMTP</span>, POP3, and <span style="color: inherit;">IMAP</span> become SMTPS, POP3S, and IMAPS, respectively. Using these protocols over TLS is no different than using <span style="color: inherit;">HTTP</span> over TLS; therefore, almost all the points from the HTTPS discussion apply to these protocols.

The insecure versions use the default <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> port numbers shown in the table below:

| Protocol | Default Port Number |
| --- | --- |
| <span style="color: inherit;">HTTP</span> | 80  |
| <span style="color: inherit;">SMTP</span> | 25  |
| <span style="color: inherit;">POP3</span> | 110 |
| <span style="color: inherit;">IMAP</span> | 143 |

The secure versions, i.e., over TLS, use the following <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> port numbers by default:

| Protocol | Default Port Number |
| --- | --- |
| HTTPS | 443 |
| SMTPS | 465 and 587 |
| POP3S | 995 |
| IMAPS | 993 |

TLS can be added to many other protocols; the reasoning and advantages would be similar.
