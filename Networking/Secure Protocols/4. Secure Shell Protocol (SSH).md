# Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)

Although it is very convenient to log in and administer remote systems using `telnet`, it is risky when all the traffic is sent in cleartext. It is easy for anyone monitoring the network traffic to get hold of your login credentials once you use `telnet`. This problem necessitated a solution. Tatu Ylönen developed the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol and released SSH-1 in 1995 as freeware. (Interestingly, it was the same year that Netscape Communications released the SSL 2.0 protocol.) A more secure version, SSH-2, was defined in 1996. In 1999, the OpenBSD developers released OpenSSH, an open-source implementation of SSH. Nowadays, when you use an SSH client, it is most likely based on OpenSSH libraries and source code.

OpenSSH offers several benefits. We will list a few key points:

- **Secure authentication**: Besides password-based authentication, <span style="color: inherit;">SSH</span> supports public key and two-factor authentication.
- **Confidentiality**: OpenSSH provides end-to-end encryption, protecting against eavesdropping. Furthermore, it notifies you of new server keys to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Integrity**: In addition to protecting the confidentiality of the exchanged data, cryptography also protects the integrity of the traffic.
- **Tunneling**: <span style="color: inherit;">SSH</span> can create a secure “tunnel” to route other protocols through <span style="color: inherit;">SSH</span>. This setup leads to a <span style="color: inherit;">VPN</span>\-like connection.
- **X11 Forwarding**: If you connect to a Unix-like system with a graphical user interface, <span style="color: inherit;">SSH</span> allows you to use the graphical application over the network.

You would issue the command `ssh username@hostname` to connect to an <span style="color: inherit;">SSH</span> server. If the username is the same as your logged-in username, you only need `ssh hostname`. Then, you will be asked for a password; however, if public-key authentication is used, you will be logged in immediately.

The screenshot below shows an example of running Wireshark on a remote Kali <span style="color: inherit;">Linux</span> system. The argument `-X` is required to support running graphical interfaces, for example, `ssh 192.168.124.148 -X`. (The local system needs to have a suitable graphical system installed).

While the TELNET server listens on port 23, the SSH server listens on port 22.
