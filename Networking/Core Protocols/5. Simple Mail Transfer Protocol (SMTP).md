# Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

As with browsing the web and downloading files, sending email needs its own protocol. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) defines how a mail client talks with a mail server and how a mail server talks with another.

The analogy for the SMTP protocol is when you go to the local post office to send a package. You greet the employee, tell them where you want to send your package, and provide the sender’s information before handing them the package. Depending on the country you are in, you might be asked to show your identity card. This process is not very different from an SMTP session.

Let’s present some of the commands used by your mail client when it transfers an email to an <span style="color: inherit;">SMTP</span> server:

- `HELO` or `EHLO` initiates an <span style="color: inherit;">SMTP</span> session
- `MAIL FROM` specifies the sender’s email address
- `RCPT TO` specifies the recipient’s email address
- `DATA` indicates that the client will begin sending the content of the email message.
- `.` is sent on a line by itself to indicate the end of the content

The terminal below shows an example of an email sent via `telnet`. The <span style="color: inherit;">SMTP</span> server listens on <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> port 25 by default.

```shell
bobinsson@BoB$ telnet 10.10.63.31 25

Obviously, sending an email using `telnet` is quite cumbersome; however, it helps you better understand the commands that your email client issues under the hood. The Wireshark capture shows the exchange in colours; the client’s messages are in red, while the server’s responses are in blue.

Now that we have covered some basic HTTP, FTP, and SMTP commands, you should have gained a solid understanding of how protocols are designed and used. It should be effortless to learn how other text-based protocols, such as POP3 and IMAP, work.
