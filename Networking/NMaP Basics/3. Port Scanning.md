# Port Scanning

At [Host Discovery](../../Networking/NMaP%20Basics/2.%20Host%20Discovery.md), we used `-sn` to discover live hosts. Now we want to discover the network services listening on these live hosts. By network service, we mean any process that is listening for incoming connections on a TCP or UDP port. Common network services include web servers, which usually listen on TCP ports 80 and 443, and <span style="color: inherit;">DNS</span> servers, which typically listen on <span style="color: inherit;">UDP</span> (and <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span>) port 53.

By design, TCP has 65,535 ports, and the same applies to <span style="color: inherit;">UDP</span>. How can we determine which ports have a service bound to it? Let’s find out.

## Scanning TCP Ports

The easiest and most basic way to know whether a <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> port is open would be to attempt to `telnet` to the port. If you are inclined to scan a network range with a Telnet client, you will try to establish a <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> connection with every target port. In other words, you attempt to complete the <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> three-way handshake with every target port; however, only open <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> ports would respond appropriately and allow a <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> connection to be established. This procedure is not very different from <span style="color: inherit;">Nmap</span>’s connect scan.

### Connect Scan

The connect scan can be triggered using `-sT`. It tries to complete the <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> three-way handshake with every target <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> port. If the <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> port turns out to be open and <span style="color: inherit;">Nmap</span> connects successfully, <span style="color: inherit;">Nmap</span> will tear down the established connection.

In the screenshot below, our scanning machine has the IP address `192.168.124.148` and the target system has <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> port 22 open and port 23 closed. In the part marked with 1, you can see how the <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> three-way handshake was completed and later torn down with a <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> RST-ACK packet by Nmap. The part marked with 2 shows a connection attempt to a closed port, and the target system responded with a <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> RST-ACK packet.

### SYN Scan (Stealth)

Unlike the connect scan, which tries to **connect** to the target <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> port, i.e., complete a three-way handshake, the SYN scan only executes the first step: it sends a <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> SYN packet. Consequently, the <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> three-way handshake is never completed. The advantage is that this is expected to lead to fewer logs as the connection is never established, and hence, it is considered a relatively stealthy scan. You can select the SYN scan using the `-sS` flag.

In the screenshot below, we scan the same system with port 22 open. The part marked with 1 shows the listening service replying with a <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> SYN-ACK packet. However, Nmap responded with a <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> RST packet instead of completing the <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> three-way handshake. The part marked with 2 shows a <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> connection attempt to a closed port. In this case, the packet exchange is the same as in the connect scan.

## Scanning UDP Ports

Although most services use TCP for communication, many use UDP. Examples include <span style="color: inherit;">DNS</span>, DHCP, NTP (Network Time Protocol), SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), and VoIP (Voice over IP). <span style="color: inherit;">UDP</span> does not require establishing a connection and tearing it down afterwards. Furthermore, it is very suitable for real-time communication, such as live broadcasts. All these are reasons to consider scanning for and discovering services listening on <span style="color: inherit;">UDP</span> ports.

<span style="color: inherit;">Nmap</span> offers the option `-sU` to scan for <span style="color: inherit;">UDP</span> services. Because <span style="color: inherit;">UDP</span> is simpler than TCP, we expect the traffic to differ. The screenshot below shows several ICMP destination unreachable (port unreachable) responses as Nmap sends <span style="color: inherit;">UDP</span> packets to closed <span style="color: inherit;">UDP</span> ports.

## Limiting the Target Ports

<span style="color: inherit;">Nmap</span> scans the most common 1,000 ports by default. However, this might not be what you are looking for. Therefore, <span style="color: inherit;">Nmap</span> offers you a few more options.

- `-F` is for Fast mode, which scans the 100 most common ports (instead of the default 1000).
- `-p[range]` allows you to specify a range of ports to scan. For example, `-p10-1024` scans from port 10 to port 1024, while `-p-25` will scan all the ports between 1 and 25. Note that `-p-` scans all the ports and is equivalent to `-p1-65535` and is the best option if you want to be as thorough as possible.

## Summary

| Option | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `-sT` | <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> connect scan – complete three-way handshake |
| `-sS` | <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> SYN – only first step of the three-way handshake |
| `-sU` | <span style="color: inherit;">UDP</span> scan |
| `-F` | Fast mode – scans the 100 most common ports |
| `-p[range]` | Specifies a range of port numbers – `-p-` scans all the ports |
