# Summary

Nmap can be used to discover live hosts on any network, offering many types of port scans and ways to find service version numbers. Scans can have their timing controlled and their result output saved to different file formats.

It is worth noting that it is best to run <span style="color: inherit;">Nmap</span> with `sudo` privileges so that we can make use of all its features. Running <span style="color: inherit;">Nmap</span> with local user privileges will still work; however, you should expect many features to be unavailable. You get a minimal portion of <span style="color: inherit;">Nmap</span>’s power when running it as a local user. For instance, <span style="color: inherit;">Nmap</span> would automatically use SYN scan (`-sS`) if you are running it with `sudo` privileges and will default to connect scan (`-sT`) if run as a local user. The reason is that crafting certain packets, such as sending a <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> SYN packet, requires root privileges.

The table below lists most of the options explained to help you review and remember them.

| Option | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `-sL` | List scan – list targets without scanning |
| ***Host Discovery*** |     |
| `-sn` | Ping scan – host discovery only |
| ***Port Scanning*** |     |
| `-sT` | <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> connect scan – complete three-way handshake |
| `-sS` | <span style="color: inherit;">TCP</span> SYN – only first step of the three-way handshake |
| `-sU` | <span style="color: inherit;">UDP</span> Scan |
| `-F` | Fast mode – scans the 100 most common ports |
| `-p[range]` | Specifies a range of port numbers – `-p-` scans all the ports |
| `-Pn` | Treat all hosts as online – scan hosts that appear to be down |
| ***Service Detection*** |     |
| `-O` | <span style="color: inherit;">OS</span> detection |
| `-sV` | Service version detection |
| `-A` | <span style="color: inherit;">OS</span> detection, version detection, and other additions |
| ***Timing*** |     |
| `-T<0-5>` | Timing template – paranoid (0), sneaky (1), polite (2), normal (3), aggressive (4), and insane (5) |
| `--min-parallelism <numprobes>` and `--max-parallelism <numprobes>` | Minimum and maximum number of parallel probes |
| `--min-rate <number>` and `--max-rate <number>` | Minimum and maximum rate (packets/second) |
| `--host-timeout` | Maximum amount of time to wait for a target host |
| ***Real-time output*** |     |
| `-v` | Verbosity level – for example, `-vv` and `-v4` |
| `-d` | Debugging level – for example `-d` and `-d9` |
| ***Report*** |     |
| `-oN <filename>` | Normal output |
| `-oX <filename>` | <span style="color: inherit;">XML</span> output |
| `-oG <filename>` | `grep`\-able output |
| `-oA <basename>` | Output in all major formats |
