# Data Link Layer

The data link layer, i.e., layer 2, represents the protocol that enables data transfer between nodes on the same network segment. Let’s put it in simpler terms. The data link layer describes an agreement between the different systems on the same network segment on how to communicate. A network segment refers to a group of networked devices using a shared medium or channel for information transfer. For example, consider a company office with ten computers connected to a network switch; that’s a network segment.

The data link layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. It receives a packet from the network layer (including the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical MAC (Media Access Control) address of the receiving endpoint. Inside every network-enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (NIC) which comes with a unique MAC address to identify it.

Examples of layer 2 include Ethernet, i.e., 802.3, and WiFi, i.e., 802.11. Ethernet and WiFi addresses are six bytes. Their address is called a MAC address, where MAC stands for Media Access Control. They are usually expressed in hexadecimal format with a colon separating each two bytes. The three leftmost bytes identify the vendor.

MAC addresses are set by the manufacturer and literally burnt into the card; they can't be changed - although they can be spoofed. When information is sent across a network, it's actually the physical address that is used to identify where exactly to send information.

Additionally, it is also the job of the data link layer to present the data in a format suitable for transmission.

We expect to see two MAC addresses in each frame in real network communication over Ethernet or WiFi. The packet in the screenshot below shows:

- The destination data-link address (MAC address) highlighted in yellow
- The source data link address (MAC address) is highlighted in blue
- The remaining bits show the data being sent
