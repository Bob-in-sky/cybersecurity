# Network Layer

The network layer is where the routing & re-assembly of data takes place (from the small chunks to the larger chunks). Routing simply determines the most optimal path in which these chunks of data should be sent.

Whilst some protocols at this layer determine exactly what is the optimal path data should take to reach a device. These protocols include OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and RIP (Routing Information Protocol). The factors that decide what route is taken is decided by the following:

- What path is the shortest? i.e has the least amount of devices that the packet has to travel across.
- What path is the most reliable? i.e. have packets been lost on that path before?
- Which path has the faster physical connection? i.e. is one path using a copper connection (slower) orÂ  a fibre (considerably faster)?

At this layer, everything is dealt with via IP addresses such as 192.168.1.100. Devices such as routers capable of delivering packets using IP addresses are known as Layer 3 devices - because they are capable of working at the third layer of the OSI model.
