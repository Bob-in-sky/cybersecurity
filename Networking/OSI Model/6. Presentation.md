# Presentation Layer

The presentation layer is where standardization starts to take place. Because software developers can develop any software, such as an email client, differently, the data still needs to be handled the same way - no matter how the software works.

This layer acts as a translator for data to and from the application layer (layer 7). The receiving computer will also understand data sent to a computer in one format destined for in another format. For example, when you send an email, the other user may have another email client, but the contents of the email will still need to display the same.
