# Application Layer

The application layer of the OSI is the layer in which protocols and rules are in place to determine how the user should interact with the data sent or received.

Everyday applications such as email clients, browsers, or file server browsing software such as FireZilla provide a friendly, Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to interact with data sent or retrieved. Other protocols include DNS (Domain Name System), which is how website addresses are translated into IP addresses.

The application layer provides network services directly to end-user applications. Your web browser would use the HTTP protocol to request a file, submit a form, or upload a file.

The application layer is the top layer, and you might have encountered many of its protocols as you use different applications. Examples of Layer 7 protocols are HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3, SMTP, and IMAP. Donâ€™t worry if you are not familiar with all of them.
