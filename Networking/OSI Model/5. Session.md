# Session Layer

The session layer is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and synchronising communication between applications running on different hosts. Establishing a session means initiating communication between applications and negotiating the necessary parameters for the session. Data synchronization ensures that data is transmitted in the correct order and provides mechanisms for recovery in case of transmission failures.

Once data has been correctly translated or formatted from the presentation layer (layer 6), the session (layer 5) will begin to create and maintain the connection to the other computer for which the data is destined. When a connection is established, a session is created. Whilst this connection is active, so is the session.

The session layer is also responsible for closing the connection if it hasn't been used in a while or if it is lost. Additionally, a session can contain "checkpoints", where if the data is lost, only the newest pieces of data are required to be sent, saving bandwidth.

What is worthy of noting is that sessions are unique - meaning that data cannot travel over different sessions, but in fact, only across each session instead.

Examples of the session layer are Network File System (NFS) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC).
