# Physical Layer

This layer is one of the easiest layers to grasp. Put simply, this layer references the physical components of the hardware used in networking and is the lowest layer that you will find. Devices use electrical signals to transfer data between each other in a binary numbering system.

The physical layer, also referred to as layer 1, deals with the physical connection between devices; this includes the medium, such as a wire, and the definition of the binary digits 0 and 1. Data transmission can be via an electrical, optical, or wireless signal. Consequently, we need data cables or antennas, depending on our physical medium.

For example, ethernet cables connecting devices. In addition to Ethernet cable, shown in the illustration below, and optical fiber cable, examples of the physical layer medium include the WiFi radio bands, the 2.4 GHz band, the 5 GHz band, and the 6 GHz band.<img src="../../_resources/55aa4167dbe16129b84867993bce223d.svg" alt="55aa4167dbe16129b84867993bce223d.svg" width="424" height="297" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" class="jop-noMdConv">
