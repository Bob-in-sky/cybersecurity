# Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

Whenever we want to access a network, at the very least, we need to configure the following:

- IP address along with subnet mask
- Router (or gateway)
- <span style="color: inherit;">DNS</span> server

Whenever we connect our device to a new network, the above configurations must be set according to the new network. Manually configuring these settings is a good option, especially for servers. Servers are not expected to switch networks; you don’t carry your domain controller and connect it to the coffee shop WiFi. Moreover, other devices need to connect to the servers and expect to find them at specific IP addresses.

Having an automated way to configure connected devices has many advantages. First, it would save us from manually configuring the network; this is extremely important, especially for mobile devices. Secondly, it avoids address conflicts, i.e., when two devices are configured with the same IP address. An IP address conflict would prevent the involved hosts from using the network resources; this applies to local resources and the internet. The solution lies in using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). DHCP is an application-level protocol that relies on UDP; the server listens on UDP port 67, and the client sends from UDP port 68. Your smartphone and laptop are configured to use DHCP by default.

| D   | Discover |
| --- | --- |
| O   | Offer |
| R   | Request |
| A   | Acknowledge |

DHCP follows four steps: Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledge (DORA):

1.  **<span style="color: inherit;">DHCP</span> Discover**: The client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message seeking the local <span style="color: inherit;">DHCP</span> server if one exists.
2.  **<span style="color: inherit;">DHCP</span> Offer**: The server responds with a DHCPOFFER message with an IP address available for the client to accept.
3.  **<span style="color: inherit;">DHCP</span> Request**: The client responds with a DHCPREQUEST message to indicate that it has accepted the offered IP.
4.  **<span style="color: inherit;">DHCP</span> Acknowledge**: The server responds with a DHCPACK message to confirm that the offered IP address is now assigned to this client.

The following packet capture shows the four steps explained above. In this example, the client gets the address `192.168.66.133`.

```Shell
bobinsson@BoB$ tshark -r DHCP-G5000.pcap -n
    1   0.000000      0.0.0.0 → 255.255.255.255 DHCP 342 DHCP Discover - Transaction ID 0xfb92d53f
    2   0.013904 192.168.66.1 → 192.168.66.133 DHCP 376 DHCP Offer    - Transaction ID 0xfb92d53f
    3   4.115318      0.0.0.0 → 255.255.255.255 DHCP 342 DHCP Request  - Transaction ID 0xfb92d53f
    4   4.228117 192.168.66.1 → 192.168.66.133 DHCP 376 DHCP ACK      - Transaction ID 0xfb92d53f
```

In the DHCP packet exchange, we can notice the following:

- The client starts without any IP network configuration. It only has a MAC address. In the first and third packets, <span style="color: inherit;">DHCP</span> Discover and <span style="color: inherit;">DHCP</span> Request, the client searching for a <span style="color: inherit;">DHCP</span> server still has no IP network configuration and has not yet used the <span style="color: inherit;">DHCP</span> server’s offered IP address. Therefore, it sends packets from the IP address `0.0.0.0` to the broadcast IP address `255.255.255.255`.
- As for the link layer, in the first and third packets, the client sends to the broadcast MAC address, `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` (not shown in the output above). The <span style="color: inherit;">DHCP</span> server offers an available IP address along with the network configuration in the <span style="color: inherit;">DHCP</span> offer. It uses the client’s destination MAC address. (It used the proposed IP address in this example system.)

At the end of the <span style="color: inherit;">DHCP</span> process, our device would have received all the configuration needed to access the network or even the Internet. In particular, we expect that the <span style="color: inherit;">DHCP</span> server has provided us with the following:

- The leased IP address to access network resources
- The gateway to route our packets outside the local network
- A <span style="color: inherit;">DNS</span> server to resolve domain names
