# Data Link Layer

The data link layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. It receives a packet from the network layer (including the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical MAC (Media Access Control) address of the receiving endpoint. Inside every network-enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (NIC) which comes with a unique MAC address to identify it.

MAC addresses are set by the manufacturer and literally burnt into the card; they can't be changed - although they can be spoofed. When information is sent across a network, it's actually the physical address that is used to identify where exactly to send information.

Additionally, it is also the job of the data link layer to present the data in a format suitable for transmission.
