# Networking

Networks are formed by the connection between things. In computing, it represents the connection of technological devices, like phones or computers. A network can be formed by any number of devices and are integrated into our everyday life, be it by gathering data, delivering electricity, or controlling systems. Because networks are so embedded in the modern-day, networking is an essential concept to grasp in cybersecurity.

## Internet

The first iteration of the Internet was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s. This project was funded by the United States Defence Department and was the first documented network in action. However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as we know it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW). It wasn't until this point that the Internet started to be used as a repository for storing and sharing information, just like it is today.

The internet is one giant network, consisting of many small networks within itself.

These small networks are called private networks, where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks -- or the Internet! So, to recap, a network can be one of two types:

- private network
- public network

Devices will use a set of labels to identify themselves on a network.
