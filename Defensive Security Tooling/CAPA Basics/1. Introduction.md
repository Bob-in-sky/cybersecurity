# Introduction

One of the challenges when analyzing potentially malicious software is that we risk our machine or environment being compromised when we run it unless we have a sandbox or a completely isolated environment where we can test all we want. Generally speaking, there are two types of analysis: dynamic analysis and static analysis. This module will focus on conducting static analysis using a tool called CAPA.

CAPA (Common Analysis Platform for Artifacts) is a tool developed by the FireEye Mandiant team. It is designed to **identify the capabilities** present in executable files like Portable Executables (<span style="color: inherit;">PE</span>), ELF binaries, .NET modules, shellcode, and even sandbox reports. It does so by analyzing the file and applying a set of rules that **describe common behaviours**, allowing it to determine what the **program is capable of doing**, such as **network communication**, **file manipulation**, **process injection**, and many more.

The beauty of CAPA is that it encapsulates years of reverse engineering knowledge into an automated tool, making it accessible even to those who may not be experts in reverse engineering. This can be incredibly useful for analysts and security professionals, allowing them to quickly understand potentially malicious software's functionality without manually reverse engineering the code.

This tool is particularly useful in malware analysis and threat hunting, where understanding a binary's capabilities is crucial for incident response and defensive measures.

CAPA is an open-source tool developed by **MANDIANT (previously FireEye)** for analyzing executable files to identify their potential capabilities. It is primarily used in malware analysis and reverse engineering to determine what a binary can do without executing it.

## Key Features of CAPA:

1.  **Static Analysis of Executables** – Analyzes PE (Portable Executable) and ELF files without running them.
2.  **Detection of Malware Capabilities** – Identifies behaviors such as file operations, process injection, network communication, persistence mechanisms, and encryption.
3.  **Pattern Matching with Rules** – Uses a rule-based system to match functions and behaviors against known techniques.
4.  **YARA-Like Rule Syntax** – Allows analysts to create custom rules for specific threat hunting or malware analysis needs.
5.  **Supports Multiple Architectures** – Works with **x86, x64, and ARM** binaries.
6.  **Integration with Other Tools** – Works alongside IDA Pro, Ghidra, and other reverse engineering tools.

## How CAPA Works:

- It **deconstructs a binary** and applies its rule set to determine which capabilities exist.
- Outputs a structured report listing the detected behaviors.
- Helps analysts quickly **identify potential threats** without requiring full manual reverse engineering.

## Use Cases:

- **Malware Analysis** – Quickly identifies how a malware sample behaves.
- **Threat Intelligence** – Helps in profiling malware families.
- **Incident Response** – Speeds up investigation by providing insights into binary functionality.
- **Reverse Engineering** – Reduces manual analysis time.

CAPA is a powerful and efficient tool for detecting malicious behaviors in binaries, making it widely used in cybersecurity research, malware analysis, and digital forensics.
