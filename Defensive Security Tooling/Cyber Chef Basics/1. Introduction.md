# Introduction

CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web-based application designed to help with various “cyber” operation tasks within your web browser. Think of it as a **Swiss Army knife** for data - like having a toolbox of different tools designed to do a specific task. These tasks range from simple encodings like **<span style="color: inherit;">XOR</span>** or **Base64** to complex operations like **<span style="color: inherit;">AES</span> encryption** or **<span style="color: inherit;">RSA</span> decryption**. CyberChef operates on **recipes**, a series of operations executed in order.

CyberChef is a web-based tool created by GCHQ (the UK Government Communications Headquarters) for performing a wide range of data transformations, encoding, decoding, encryption, and analysis tasks. It is often used by cybersecurity professionals, developers, and analysts to process and manipulate data efficiently.

### Features of CyberChef:

1.  **Encoding and Decoding** – Supports Base64, URL encoding, hexadecimal, binary, and many other formats.
2.  **Encryption and Decryption** – Provides algorithms like AES, DES, RSA, and XOR for cryptographic operations.
3.  **Data Extraction** – Can extract IP addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and other structured data from text.
4.  **Compression and Decompression** – Works with Gzip, ZIP, and other compression methods.
5.  **Parsing and Conversion** – Converts between formats such as JSON, XML, and CSV, and parses log files.
6.  **Hashing** – Generates hash values using MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and more.
7.  **Binary and Hex Operations** – Allows bitwise operations, conversions, and manipulations.
8.  **Forensic Analysis** – Helps analyze and decode encoded or obfuscated data.
9.  **Automation via Recipes** – Users can create workflows by chaining multiple operations into a "recipe" for automated processing.

### Benefits of Using CyberChef:

- **No Installation Required** – Runs in a web browser without the need for installation.
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Provides a drag-and-drop workflow builder.
- **Customizable and Extensible** – Allows users to build and save custom processing pipelines.
- **Offline Use** – Can be downloaded and run locally for security-sensitive tasks.

CyberChef is widely used for cybersecurity investigations, digital forensics, malware analysis, and data transformations, making it a valuable tool for both technical and non-technical users.
