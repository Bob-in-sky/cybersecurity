# Conclusion

In this module, we had a hands-on introduction to the REMnux <span style="color: inherit;">VM</span>, where we could use tools like **oledump.py** for file analysis. We also created a fake network using **INetSim** and preprocessed a memory capture using **volatility and strings**. **All of these tools are included just inside the REMNux <span style="color: inherit;">VM</span>!** Still, we haven't used many of its tools yet, as we could create different rooms for each to learn and become familiar with it.

On a side note, REMnux Distro mainly focuses on analyses of potentially malicious programs, documents or files, memory, and similar objects.
