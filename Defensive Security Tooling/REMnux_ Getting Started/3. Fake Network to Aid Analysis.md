# Fake Network to Aid Analysis

During <span style="color: inherit;">dynamic analysis</span>, it is essential to observe the behaviour of potentially malicious software—especially its network activities. There are many approaches to this. We can create a whole infrastructure, a virtual environment with different core machines, and more. Alternatively, there is a tool inside our REMnux <span style="color: inherit;">VM</span> called **INetSim: Internet Services Simulation Suite!**

We will utilize INetSim's features to simulate a real network in this module.

## Virtual Machines

For this module, we will simulate two (2) machines. The first is our REMnux machine. The second <span style="color: inherit;">VM</span> is the AttackBox.

&nbsp;

## INetSim

Before we start, we must configure the tool INetSim inside our REMnux <span style="color: inherit;">VM</span>. Do not worry; this is a simple change of configuration. First, check the IP address assigned to your machine. This can be seen using the command `ifconfig` or simply by checking the IP address from the terminal. *The IP addresses may vary.*

Here, the machine’s IP is `10.10.28.63`. Take note of this, as we will need it.

Next, we need to change the INetSim configuration by running this command `sudo nano /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf` and look for the value `#dns_default_ip 0.0.0.0`.

```shell
bob@BoB~$ sudo nano /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf
#########################################
# dns_default_ip
#
# Default IP address to return with DNS replies
#
# Syntax: dns_default_ip 
#
# Default: 127.0.0.1
#
#dns_default_ip  0.0.0.0
```

Remove the comment or **#**, then change the value of **dns_default_ip** from `0.0.0.0` to the machine’s IP address you have identified earlier. In our case, this is `10.10.28.63`. Save the file using `CRTL + O` command, press enter and exit using `CTRL + X`.

Confirm that the changes have been successful by checking the value of `dns_default_ip` using this command `cat /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf | grep dns_default_ip`. See below.

```shell
bob@BoB~$ cat /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf | grep dns_default_ip
# dns_default_ip
# Syntax: dns_default_ip 
dns_default_ip	 10.10.28.63
```

Finally, run the command `sudo inetsim` to start the tool.

```shell
bob@BoB~$ sudo inetsim

```

After running the command, ensure you see the sentence "**Simulation running**" at the bottom of the result and ignore **the http_80_tcp—failed!** Our fake network is now running!

&nbsp;

## AttackBox

From the AttackBox, we open a browser and go to our REMnux's IP address using the command `https://10.10.28.63`. This will prompt a Security Risk; ignore it, click **Advance**, then **Accept the Risk and Continue.**

<img src="../../_resources/fbb435c238a186a5b9d5e915b6ab90cb.png" alt=" This image demonstrate the instructions mentioned where in you should click on Advance, then proceed to Accept the Risk and Continue." width="672" height="451" class="jop-noMdConv" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;">

Once done, you should be redirected to the INetSim's homepage!

<img src="../../_resources/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1727039.png" alt="This image shows the output or the desired result when the tool INetSim is started without any issues" width="1192" height="233" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;">

One usual malware behaviour is downloading another binary or script. We will try to mimic this behaviour by getting another file from INetsim. We can do this via the <span style="color: inherit;">CLI</span> or browser, but let's use the <span style="color: inherit;">CLI</span> to make it more realistic. Use this command: `sudo wget https://10.10.28.63/second_payload.zip --no-check-certificate`.

```shell
bob@BoB~# sudo wget https://10.10.28.63/second_payload.zip --no-check-certificate
--2024-09-22 22:18:49--  https://10.10.28.63/second_payload.zip

2024-09-22 22:18:49 (14.5 MB/s) - \u2018second_payload.zip\u2019 saved [258/258]
```

You can try downloading another file as well. For example, try downloading **second_payload.ps1** by using the command:`sudo wget https://10.10.28.63/second_payload.ps1 --no-check-certificate`.

To verify that the files were downloaded, check your root folder. See the sample below.

<img src="../../_resources/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1727040.png" alt=" This image shows the result of downloading the files as instructed. You should be able to see similar to what is shown from this image. There should be two files downloaded namely second_payload.zip and second_payload.ps1" width="1282" height="205" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;">

All of these are fake files! Try to open the second_payload.ps1. When executed, this will direct you to INetSim's homepage.

What we did here is **mimic a malware's behaviour**, wherein it will try to reach out to a server or URL and then **download a secondary file that may contain another malware**.

&nbsp;

## Connection Report

Lastly, go back to your REMnux <span style="color: inherit;">VM</span> and stop INetSim. By default, it will create a report on its captured connections. This is usually saved in **/var/log/inetsim/report/** directory. You should be able to see something like this.

```shell
Report written to '/var/log/inetsim/report/report.2594.txt' (14 lines)
=== INetSim main process stopped (PID 2594) ===
```

Read the file using this command `sudo cat /var/log/inetsim/report/report.2594.txt`. This may differ from your machine.

```shell
bob@BoB~$ sudo cat /var/log/inetsim/report/report.2594.txt
=== Report for session '2594' ===

```

These are the logs when the tool was running. We can see the connections made to the URL, the protocol, and the method it's using. We can also see the fake file that was downloaded.
