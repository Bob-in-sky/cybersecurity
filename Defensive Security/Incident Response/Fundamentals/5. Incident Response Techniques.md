# Incident Response Techniques

Remember we studied the second phase of the incident response lifecycle, ‘Identification’ in SANS, and ‘Detection and Analysis’ in <span style="color: inherit;">NIST</span>. It is very hard to look for abnormal behavior and identify incidents manually. There are multiple security solutions that serve their own unique roles in detecting any incidents. Some of them even have the capability to respond to the incidents and execute the other phases of the lifecycle, such as containment, eradication, etc. A brief explanation of some of these solutions is given below:

- **<span style="color: inherit;">SIEM</span>:** The Security Information and Event Management Solution (<span style="color: inherit;">SIEM</span>) collects all important logs in one centralized location and correlates them to identify incidents.
- **<span style="color: inherit;">AV</span>:** Antivirus (<span style="color: inherit;">AV</span>) detects known malicious programs in a system and regularly scans your system for these.
- **<span style="color: inherit;">EDR</span>:** Endpoint Detection and Response (<span style="color: inherit;">EDR</span>) is deployed on every system, protecting it against some advanced-level threats. This solution can also contain and eradicate the threat.

After incidents are identified, certain procedures must be followed, including investigating the extent of the attack, taking necessary actions to prevent further damage and eliminate it from the root. These steps may be different for different kinds of incidents. In this scenario, having step-by-step instructions to deal with each kind of incident helps you save a lot of time. These types of instructions are known as **Playbooks**.

**Playbooks** are the guidelines for a comprehensive incident response.

Following is an example of a **Playbook** for an incident: <span style="color: inherit;">Phishing</span> Email

1.  Notify all the stakeholders of the <span style="color: inherit;">phishing</span> email incident
2.  Determine if the email was malicious by conducting header and body analysis of the email
3.  Look for any attachments with the email and analyze them
4.  Determine if anybody opened the attachments
5.  Isolate the infected systems from the network
6.  Block the email sender

**Runbooks**, on the other hand, are the detailed, step-by-step execution of specific steps during different incidents. These steps may vary depending on the resources available for investigation.
