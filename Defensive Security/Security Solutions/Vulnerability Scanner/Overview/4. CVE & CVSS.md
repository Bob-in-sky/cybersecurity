# CVE & CVSS

Imagine yourself as the person sitting on the help desk of an IT complaint office managing many clients. You deal with hundreds of complaints daily regarding IT outages or several other problems requiring support from your company. Let’s see how <span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> and <span style="color: inherit;">CVSS</span> help you track all these inquiries and complaints.

## <span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span>

<span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. Consider <span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> a unique number for each of your inquiries and complaints. If there is any update to any issue, you can easily follow up on that using the unique <span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> number. Coming out of the help desk example scenario, this <span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> number is a unique number given to vulnerabilities. This was developed by the <span style="color: inherit;">MITRE</span> Corporation. Whenever a new vulnerability is discovered in any software application, it is given a unique <span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> number as a reference and published online in a <span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> database. This publication aims to make people aware of these vulnerabilities so they can apply protective measures to remediate them. You can find the details of any previously discovered vulnerability in the <span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> database. An example of a <span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> number given to a vulnerability can be seen in the picture below:

- **<span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> prefix:** Every <span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> number has the prefix “<span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span>” in the beginning.
- **Year:** The second part of every <span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> number contains the year it was discovered (e.g., 2024).
- **Arbitrary Digits:** The last part of the <span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> numbers contains four or more arbitrary digits (e.g., 9374)

## <span style="color: inherit;">CVSS</span>

<span style="color: inherit;">CVSS</span> stands for Common Vulnerability Scoring System. If we return to the help desk example again, you would always need to prioritize the complaints. The most efficient way to prioritize the complaints is by their severity level. What if all your complaints are registered with a score ranging from 0 to 10, where a higher score indicates a more severe complaint? This would resolve the problem of prioritizing critical complaints. This is called a <span style="color: inherit;">CVSS</span> score. In the computing world, just as each vulnerability has a <span style="color: inherit;">CVE</span> number that uniquely identifies it, each has a <span style="color: inherit;">CVSS</span> score that tells you its severity. The <span style="color: inherit;">CVSS</span> score is calculated by considering multiple factors, including its impact, ease of exploitability, etc. The severity as per the <span style="color: inherit;">CVSS</span> scores can be seen in the table below:

| <span style="color: inherit;">CVSS</span> Score Range | Severity Levels |
| --- | --- |
| 0.0-3.9 | Low |
| 4.0-6.9 | Medium |
| 7.0-8.9 | High |
| 9.0-10 | Critical |
