# Why SIEM

<span style="color: inherit;">SIEM</span> is used to provide correlation on the collected data to detect threats. Once a threat is detected, or a certain threshold is crossed, an alert is raised. This alert enables the analysts to take suitable actions based on the investigation. <span style="color: inherit;">SIEM</span> plays an important role in the Cyber Security domain and helps detect and protect against the latest threats in a timely manner. It provides good visibility of what's happening within the network infrastructure.

## <span style="color: inherit;">SIEM</span> Capabilities

<span style="color: inherit;">SIEM</span> is one major component of a Security Operations Center (<span style="color: inherit;">SOC</span>) ecosystem, as illustrated below. <span style="color: inherit;">SIEM</span> starts by collecting logs and examining if any event/flow has matched the condition set in the rule or crossed a certain threshold

Some of the common capabilities of <span style="color: inherit;">SIEM</span> are:

- Correlation between events from different log sources.
- Provide visibility on both Host-centric and Network-centric activities.
- Allow analysts to investigate the latest threats and timely responses.
- Hunt for threats that are not detected by the rules in place.

<span style="color: inherit;">SOC</span> Analyst Responsibilities

<span style="color: inherit;">SOC</span> Analysts utilize <span style="color: inherit;">SIEM</span> solutions in order to have better visibility of what is happening within the network. Some of their responsibilities include:

- Monitoring and Investigating.
- Identifying False positives.
- Tuning Rules which are causing the noise or False positives.
- Reporting and Compliance.
- Identifying blind spots in the network visibility and covering them.
