# Introduction

<span style="color: inherit;">A firewall</span> checks the traffic when a connection is going to take place and denies it if it violates the <span style="color: inherit;">firewall</span> rules. However, there should be some security to detect the activities of the connection that passed through the <span style="color: inherit;">firewall</span> and have already taken place. So, if an attacker successfully bypasses a <span style="color: inherit;">firewall</span> via a legitimate-looking connection and then performs any malicious activities inside the network, there should be something to detect it timely. For this purpose, we have a security solution inside the network. This solution is known as an Intrusion Detection System (<span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span>).

Think of an example of a building’s security. A <span style="color: inherit;">firewall</span> acts as the gatekeeper, checking the people coming in and going out. There is always a chance that some bad actor will successfully sneak inside and start performing malicious activities. He was missed at the gate, but what if we catch him even after he gets in? This can be done by the surveillance cameras present throughout the building. The <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> plays the role of surveillance cameras. It sits in a corner, monitors the network traffic based on its signature and anomaly-based detections, and detects any abnormal traffic going out or inside the network. Upon every detection, an alert is generated for the security administrators. <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> does not act on those detections; it only notifies the security administrators about the malicious activity.

An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** is a security solution designed to monitor network traffic or system activities for signs of malicious behavior, policy violations, or security threats. IDS helps organizations detect and respond to cyber threats before they cause significant damage.

## Key Functions of an IDS

1.  **Monitoring Traffic** – Continuously analyzes network packets or system logs.
2.  **Threat Detection** – Identifies suspicious activities, such as unauthorized access or malware infections.
3.  **Alerting Administrators** – Sends alerts when a potential attack is detected.
4.  **Logging Security Events** – Keeps records of detected incidents for further analysis.
5.  **Supporting Incident Response** – Helps security teams take corrective action against threats.

## Types of IDS

1.  **Network-Based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**
    
    - Monitors traffic across an entire network.
    - Detects attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS), port scanning, and malware propagation.
    - Example: Snort, Suricata.
2.  **Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)**
    
    - Monitors individual devices (hosts) for suspicious activity.
    - Detects changes in system files, unauthorized user access, or malware infections.
    - Example: OSSEC, Tripwire.
3.  **Signature-Based IDS**
    
    - Detects threats by comparing traffic to known attack patterns or signatures.
    - Effective against known threats but cannot detect new or unknown attacks.
4.  **Anomaly-Based IDS**
    
    - Uses machine learning or statistical models to detect deviations from normal behavior.
    - Can identify zero-day attacks but may generate false positives.
5.  **Hybrid IDS**
    
    - Combines signature-based and anomaly-based techniques for more comprehensive threat detection.

## IDS vs. IPS

An **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** is similar to an IDS but takes proactive measures to block detected threats. IDS only alerts security teams, while IPS actively prevents attacks.

## Importance of IDS

- Provides early warning of cyber threats.
- Helps prevent data breaches and system compromises.
- Enhances overall network security by identifying vulnerabilities.
