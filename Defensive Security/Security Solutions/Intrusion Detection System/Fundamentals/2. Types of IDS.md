# Types of IDS

<span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> can be categorized differently depending on certain factors. An <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span>’s main categorization depends on its deployment and detection modes.

## Deployment Modes

<span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> can be deployed in the following ways:

- **Host Intrusion Detection System (<span style="color: inherit;">HIDS</span>):** Host-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> solutions are installed individually on the hosts and are responsible for only detecting potential security threats associated with that particular host. They provide detailed visibility of the host’s activities. However, host intrusion detection systems can be challenging to manage in large networks as they are resource-intensive and require management on each host.
    
- **Network Intrusion Detection System (<span style="color: inherit;">NIDS</span>):** Network-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> solutions are crucial in detecting potentially malicious activities within the whole network, regardless of any specific hosts. They monitor the network traffic of all the hosts involved to detect suspicious activities. It provides a centralized view of all the detections inside the whole network.

## Detection Modes

- **Signature-Based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span>:** Many attacks occur every day. Each attack has its unique pattern, which is known as a signature. These signatures are preserved by the <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> in their databases so that if the same attack happens in the future, it gets detected by its signature and reported to the security administrators for action. The stronger the signature database of the <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> is, the more efficiently it would detect known threats. However, the signature-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> is unable to detect zero-day attacks. Zero-day attacks have no prior signatures (patterns) and are not saved inside the <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> databases. Therefore, the signature-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> can only detect the attacks that happened previously, and its signatures (patterns) are saved inside the database.
    
- **Anomaly-Based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span>:** This type of <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> first learns the normal behavior (baseline) of the network or system and performs detections if there is any deviation from the normal behavior. Anomaly-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> can also detect zero-day attacks because they don’t rely on the available signatures for the detections, but detect abnormalities inside the network or system by comparing the current state with the normal behavior (baseline). However, this type of <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> may generate a lot of false positives (marking benign activities as malicious) because the nature of most legitimate programs matches the malicious ones. Anomaly-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> would mark them malicious and believe anything behaving unusually is malicious. We can also reduce the false positives generated by anomaly-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> by fine-tuning it (manually defining the normal behavior in the <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span>).
    
- **Hybrid <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span>:** A hybrid <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> combines the detection methods of signature-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> and anomaly-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> to leverage the strengths of each approach. Some known threats may already have some signatures in the <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> database; in this case, the hybrid <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> would use the detection technique of the signature-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span>. If it encounters a new threat, it can leverage the detection method of anomaly-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span>.
    

Signature-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> can detect threats quickly, while other <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> can have a high processing overhead. However, it is also essential to consider the <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> based on several different factors. Signature-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> can be a good option for covering a small threat surface. Anomaly-based <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> and hybrid <span style="color: inherit;">IDS</span> can help detect modern zero-day attacks, which are increasing daily and can cause massive damage to organizations.
