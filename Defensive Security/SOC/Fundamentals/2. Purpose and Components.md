# <span style="color: #f9f9fb;">Purpose and Components</span>

The main focus of the <span style="color: inherit;">SOC</span> team is to keep **Detection** and **Response** intact. The <span style="color: inherit;">SOC</span> team has some resources available in the form of security solutions that help them achieve this. These solutions integrate the whole company’s network and all the systems to monitor them from one centralized location. Continuous monitoring is required to detect and respond to any security incident.

## Detection

- **Detect vulnerabilities**: A vulnerability is a weakness that an attacker can exploit to carry out things beyond their permission level. A vulnerability might be discovered in any device’s software (operating system and programs), such as a server or computer. For instance, the <span style="color: inherit;">SOC</span> might discover a set of MS Windows computers that must be patched against a specific published vulnerability. Strictly speaking, vulnerabilities are not necessarily the <span style="color: inherit;">SOC</span>’s responsibility; however, unfixed vulnerabilities affect the security level of the entire company.
- **Detect unauthorized activity**: Consider the case where an attacker discovered the username and password of one of the employees and used them to log in to the company system. It is crucial to detect this kind of unauthorized activity quickly before it causes any damage. Many clues, such as geographic location, can help us detect this.
- **Detect policy violations**: A security policy is a set of rules and procedures created to help protect a company against security threats and ensure compliance. What is considered a violation would vary from company to company; examples include downloading pirated media files and sending confidential company files insecurely.
- **Detect intrusions**: Intrusions refer to unauthorized access to systems and networks. One scenario would be an attacker successfully exploiting our web application. Another would be a user visiting a malicious site and getting their computer infected.

## Response

- **Support with the incident response**: Once an incident is detected, certain steps are taken to respond to it. This response includes minimizing its impact and performing the root cause analysis of the incident. The <span style="color: inherit;">SOC</span> team also helps the incident response team carry out these steps.

There are three pillars of a <span style="color: inherit;">SOC</span>. With all these pillars, a <span style="color: inherit;">SOC</span> team becomes mature and efficiently detects and responds to different incidents. These pillars are **People**, **Process**, and **Technology**.

**People**, **Process**, and **Technology** coexist in a <span style="color: inherit;">SOC</span> environment. A team of professional individuals working on state-of-the-art security tools in the presence of proper processes is what makes a mature <span style="color: inherit;">SOC</span> environment.
