# SQL Injection Vulnerability

We will see how the interaction between an application and a database happens through <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> queries and how attackers can leverage these <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> queries to perform <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> injection attacks.

**Note**: Before we proceed, please ensure that you try the manual or automated <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> injection methods only after the permission of the application owner.

Let’s take an example of a login page that asks you to enter your username and password to log in. Let’s provide it with the following data:

`Username: John`

`Password: Un@detectable444`

Once you enter your username and password, the website will receive it, make an <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> query with your credentials, and send it to the database.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'John' AND password = 'Un@detectable444';
```

This query will be executed in the database. As per this query, the database will check for a user named `John` and the password of `Un@detectable444`. If it finds such a user, it will return the user’s details to the application. Note that the above query will be successful only if the given user and pass both have a match together in the database as they are separated by the boolean “AND”.

Sometimes, when input is improperly sanitized, meaning that user input is not validated, attackers can manipulate the input and write <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> queries that would get executed in the database and perform the attacker’s desired actions. <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> injection has a very harmful effect in this digital world as all organizations store their data, including their critical information, inside the databases, and a successful <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> injection attack can compromise their critical data.

Let’s assume the website login page we discussed above lacks input validation and sanitization. This means that it is vulnerable to <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> injection. The attacker does not know the password of the user John. They will type the following input in the given fields:

`Username: John`

`Password: abc' OR 1=1;-- -`

This time, the attacker typed a random string `abc` and an injected string `' OR 1=1;-- -`. The <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> query that the website would send to the database will now become the following:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'John' AND password = 'abc' OR 1=1;-- -';
```

This statement looks similar to the previous <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> query but now adds another condition with the operator `OR`. This query will see if there is a user, John. Then, it will check if John has the password `abc` (which he could not have because the attacker entered a random password). Ideally, the query should fail here because it expects both username and password to be correct, as there is an `AND` operator between them. But, this query has another condition, `OR`, between the password and a statement `1=1`. Any one of them being true will make the whole <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> query successful. The password failed, so the query will check the next condition, which checks if `1=1`. As we know, `1=1` is always true, so it will ignore the random password entered before this and consider this statement as true, which will successfully execute this query. The `-- -` at the end of the query would comment anything after `1=1`, which means the query would be successfully executed, and the attacker would get logged in to John’s user account.

One of the important things to note here is the use of a single quote `'` after `abc`. Without this single quote,`'` the whole string `'abc OR 1=1;-- -'` would be considered the password, which is not intended. However, if we add a single quote `'` after `abc`, the password would look like `'abc' OR 1=1;-- -'`, which encloses the original string abc in the query and allows us to introduce a logical condition `OR 1=1`, which is always true.
