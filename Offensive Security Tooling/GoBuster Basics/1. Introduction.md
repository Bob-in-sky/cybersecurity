# Introduction

**Gobuster** is a command-line tool written in **Go** used for brute-force enumeration of directories, files, DNS subdomains, virtual hostnames, and Amazon S3 buckets. It is widely used in penetration testing and security assessments to discover hidden resources on web servers and domains.

Gobuster is an open-source offensive tool written in Golang. It enumerates web directories, DNS subdomains, vhosts, Amazon S3 buckets, and Google Cloud Storage by brute force, using specific wordlists and handling the incoming responses. Many security professionals use this tool for penetration testing, bug bounty hunting, and cyber security assessments. Looking at the phases of ethical hacking, we can place Gobuster between the reconnaissance and scanning phases.

Before exploring <span style="color: inherit;">Gobuster</span>, let’s briefly discuss the concepts of enumeration and Brute Force.

**Enumeration**

Enumeration is the act of listing all the available resources, whether they are accessible or not. For example, <span style="color: inherit;">Gobuster</span> enumerates web directories.

**Brute Force**

Brute force is the act of trying every possibility until a match is found. It is like having ten keys and trying them all on a lock until one fits. <span style="color: inherit;">Gobuster</span> uses wordlists for this purpose.

## Features of Gobuster

Gobuster can be used in different modes:

1.  **Directory/File Enumeration (`dir` mode)**
    
    - It brute-forces directories and files on a web server using a wordlist.
    - Equivalent to tools like **dirb** or **dirbuster** but much faster.
2.  **DNS Subdomain Enumeration (`dns` mode)**
    
    - Brute-forces subdomains using a wordlist.
    - Similar to **Sublist3r** or **dnsrecon**.
3.  **Virtual Host Enumeration (`vhost` mode)**
    
    - Enumerates virtual hosts on a server.
    - Useful for discovering hidden web applications.
4.  **S3 Bucket Enumeration (`s3` mode)**
    
    - Attempts to find open Amazon S3 storage buckets.
5.  **Fuzzing (`fuzz` mode)**
    
    - Can fuzz parameters in a URL to find vulnerabilities.

## Installation

You can find installation instructions for <span style="color: inherit;">Gobuster</span> on your own machine in the official [<span style="color: inherit;">Gobuster</span> GitHub repository](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster).

Gobuster can be installed using:

```bash
sudo apt install gobuster  # Debian-based (Kali Linux, Ubuntu)
```

or

```bash
go install github.com/OJ/gobuster/v3@latest  # Install using Go
```

## Usage Examples

### 1\. Directory and File Brute-Forcing

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

- `dir` → Directory mode
- `-u` → Target URL
- `-w` → Wordlist

➡ This will attempt to find directories and files listed in `common.txt`.

### 2\. DNS Subdomain Brute-Forcing

```bash
gobuster dns -d example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dns.txt
```

- `dns` → DNS mode
- `-d` → Target domain
- `-w` → Wordlist

➡ This will try to discover subdomains like `admin.example.com`, `mail.example.com`, etc.

### 3\. Virtual Host Enumeration

```bash
gobuster vhost -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/vhosts.txt
```

- `vhost` → Virtual host mode
- `-u` → Target URL
- `-w` → Wordlist

➡ Useful for finding hidden applications running on a server.

### 4\. Fuzzing Parameters

```bash
gobuster fuzz -u "http://example.com/index.php?param=FUZZ" -w /usr/share/wordlists/fuzz.txt
```

- `fuzz` → Fuzzing mode
- `FUZZ` → Placeholder for the fuzzing wordlist

➡ This will test different values for `param` to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Why Use Gobuster?

- **Fast and Efficient**: Written in Go, making it significantly faster than Python or Bash-based alternatives.
- **Multithreaded**: Can run multiple requests in parallel for speed.
- **Versatile**: Supports directory enumeration, DNS discovery, fuzzing, etc.
- **Extensive Wordlist Support**: Works well with custom and pre-existing wordlists.

## Alternatives

- **dirb** / **dirbuster** – Similar for directory enumeration but slower.
- **wfuzz** – More advanced fuzzing capabilities.
- **Sublist3r** – Focused on subdomain enumeration.
- **ffuf** – Fast web fuzzer with better customization.
