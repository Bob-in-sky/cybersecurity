# HTTP

HyperText Transfer Protocol is the protocol used to view websites,  developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his team between 1989-1991. HTTP is the set of rules used  for communicating with web servers for the transmitting of web page data, whether that is HTML, Images, Vieos, etc.

# HTTPS

HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure is the secure version of HTTP. HTTPS data is encrypted so it not only stops people from seeing the data you are receiving and sending, but it also gives you assurances that you're talking to the correct web server and not something impersonating it.
