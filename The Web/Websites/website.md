# Website

When you visiting a website, the browser (like Safari or Google Chrome) makes a request to a web server asking for information about the page being visited. It will respond with data that the browser uses to show the page; a web server is just a dedicated computer somewhere else in the world that handles the requests.

There are two major components that make up a website:

1.  1.  Front End (Client-Side) - the way the browser renders a website.
    2.  Back End (Server-Side) - a server that processes the request and returns a response.

There are many other processes involved in your browser making a request to a web server, but for now, you just need to understand that you make a request to a server, and it responds with data your browser uses to render information to you.
