# HTTP Response: Headers & Body

## Response Headers

When a web server responds to an <span style="color: inherit;">HTTP</span> request, it includes **<span style="color: inherit;">HTTP</span> response headers**, which are basically key-value pairs. These headers provide important info about the response and tell the client (usually the browser) how to handle it.

Picture an example of an <span style="color: inherit;">HTTP</span> response with the headers highlighted. Key headers like `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, and `Date` give us important details about the response the server sends back.

## Required Response Headers

Some response headers are crucial for making sure the <span style="color: inherit;">HTTP</span> response works properly. They provide essential info that both the client and server need to process everything correctly. Here are a few important ones:

- **Date**:  
    Example: `Date: Fri, 23 Aug 2024 10:43:21 GMT`  
    This header shows the exact date and time when the response was generated by the server.
    
- **Content-Type**:  
    Example: `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8`  
    It tells the client what kind of content it’s getting, like whether it’s HTML, <span style="color: inherit;">JSON</span>, or something else. It also includes the character set (like UTF-8) to help the browser display it properly.
    
- **Server**:  
    Example: `Server: nginx`  
    This header shows what kind of server software is handling the request. It’s good for debugging, but it can also reveal server information that might be useful for attackers, so many people remove or obscure this one.
    

## Other Common Response Headers

Besides the essential ones, there are other common headers that give additional instructions to the client or browser and help control how the response should be handled.

- **Set-Cookie**:  
    Example: `Set-Cookie: sessionId=38af1337es7a8`  
    This one sends cookies from the server to the client, which the client then stores and sends back with future requests. To keep things secure, make sure cookies are set with the `HttpOnly` flag (so they can’t be accessed by JavaScript) and the `Secure` flag (so they’re only sent over HTTPS).
    
- **Cache-Control**:  
    Example: `Cache-Control: max-age=600`  
    This header tells the client how long it can cache the response before checking with the server again. It can also prevent sensitive info from being cached if needed (using `no-cache`).
    
- **Location**:  
    Example: `Location: /index.html`  
    This one’s used in redirection (3xx) responses. It tells the client where to go next if the resource has moved. If users can modify this header during requests, be careful to validate and sanitise it—otherwise, you could end up with open redirect vulnerabilities, where attackers can redirect users to harmful sites.
    

## Response Body

The **<span style="color: inherit;">HTTP</span> response body** is where the actual data lives—things like HTML, <span style="color: inherit;">JSON</span>, images, etc., that the server sends back to the client. To prevent **injection attacks** like Cross-Site Scripting (<span style="color: inherit;">XSS</span>), always sanitise and escape any data (especially user-generated content) before including it in the response.
