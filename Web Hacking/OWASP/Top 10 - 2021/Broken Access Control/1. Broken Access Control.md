# Broken Access Control

Websites have pages that are protected from regular visitors. For example, only the site's admin user should be able to access a page to manage other users. If a website visitor can access protected pages they are not meant to see, then the access controls are broken.

Broken Access Control occurs when an application **fails to properly enforce permissions and restrictions**, allowing unauthorized users to access sensitive data or perform actions beyond their intended privileges. This vulnerability often leads to **data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and privilege escalation**.

Access control ensures that:

- Users can **only** perform actions and access data **per their role/permissions**.
- Sensitive **functions and endpoints** are restricted to authorized users.
- System-level **operations and APIs** are protected from unauthorized access.

A regular visitor being able to access protected pages can lead to the following:

- Being able to view sensitive information from other users
- Accessing unauthorized functionality
- **Data theft, account takeovers, and privilege escalation**.

Exploiting it can be as simple as **changing a URL, modifying a request, or tampering with session data**.

Simply put, broken access control allows attackers to bypass **authorization**, allowing them to view sensitive data or perform tasks they aren't supposed to.

For example, a [vulnerability was found in 2019](https://bugs.xdavidhu.me/google/2021/01/11/stealing-your-private-videos-one-frame-at-a-time/), where an attacker could get any single frame from a Youtube video marked as private. The researcher who found the vulnerability showed that he could ask for several frames and somewhat reconstruct the video. Since the expectation from a user when marking a video as private would be that nobody had access to it, this was indeed accepted as a broken access control vulnerability.

## **Common Examples of Broken Access Control**

### 1\. Unauthorized Access to Admin Functions

**Scenario:** A normal user tries to access an admin-only page.

- **Example Attack:**
    
    - The user accesses:  
        `https://example.com/admin/dashboard`
    - If no proper access control is in place, the attacker **gets admin privileges** without authentication.
- **Mitigation:**
    
    - Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)**.
    - Restrict sensitive endpoints using **server-side authorization**.

### 2\. IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)

**Scenario:** A user modifies a request to access another user's private data.

- **Example Attack:**
    
    - User **John (ID: 1001)** accesses his profile:  
        `https://example.com/user/1001/profile`
    - An attacker changes the URL to another user’s ID:  
        `https://example.com/user/1002/profile`
    - If the app does not check permissions, the attacker can see **private user data**.
- **Mitigation:**
    
    - Use **server-side access control** to verify user permissions.
    - Do not rely solely on **client-side security** (JavaScript validation).
    - Use **UUIDs** instead of sequential user IDs to make guessing harder.

### 3\. Privilege Escalation

**Scenario:** A low-privileged user manipulates input to gain higher access.

- **Example Attack:**
    
    - A regular user submits a request:
        
        json
        
        CopiarEditar
        
        `{ "role": "user" }`
        
    - An attacker modifies the request before sending:
        
        json
        
        CopiarEditar
        
        `{ "role": "admin" }`
        
    - If the backend does not validate roles, the attacker **gains admin privileges**.
        
- **Mitigation:**
    
    - **Enforce access control at the server level** (not just in the frontend).
    - Users should never be able to modify their own **roles/privileges**.
    - Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for admin actions.

* * *

### 4\. Forced Browsing

**Scenario:** Users guess and access hidden URLs or restricted files.

- **Example Attack:**
    
    - The app hides admin pages instead of restricting them:  
        `https://example.com/admin/settings`
    - If there’s no proper access control, attackers can **navigate to restricted pages** just by guessing URLs.
- **Mitigation:**
    
    - Use proper **authentication and authorization checks**.
    - Do not rely on **obscurity (hiding URLs)** as a security measure.
    - Implement **automatic session expiration** for sensitive pages.

* * *

### 5\. Bypassing API Security

**Scenario:** An attacker modifies API requests to access restricted resources.

- **Example Attack:**
    
    - A user sends a request to get their own bank details:
        
        bash
        
        CopiarEditar
        
        `GET /api/account/12345/balance`
        
    - The attacker changes the account number:
        
        bash
        
        CopiarEditar
        
        `GET /api/account/67890/balance`
        
    - If the API does not validate the logged-in user’s ownership, they can **see someone else’s balance**.
        
- **Mitigation:**
    
    - Always check **user authorization in APIs**.
    - Implement **OAuth 2.0 or token-based authentication**.
    - **Rate-limit APIs** to prevent mass enumeration.

## **How to Prevent Broken Access Control**

### Follow the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)

- Users should only have the minimum access needed to perform their tasks.

### Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Define clear **roles and permissions** (e.g., User, Moderator, Admin).
- Store permissions **securely in the backend**.

### Use Server-Side Authorization Checks

- Do **not** rely on frontend checks only (e.g., hiding admin buttons in HTML).
- Verify user roles **on every request** before executing sensitive actions.

### Deny by Default Policy

- If a user is **not explicitly authorized**, they should be **denied access**.

### Implement Strong Session Management

- Ensure **session timeouts** and **re-authentication** for sensitive actions.
- Prevent **session fixation** and **session hijacking** attacks.

### Use Secure API Authentication

- Secure APIs using **JWTs, OAuth, and API keys**.
- Ensure **rate limiting** and **IP whitelisting** for critical APIs.

### Log and Monitor Access Events

- Enable **security logging and monitoring** to detect unauthorized access.
- Use **SIEM tools** (Security Information and Event Management) for real-time alerts.
