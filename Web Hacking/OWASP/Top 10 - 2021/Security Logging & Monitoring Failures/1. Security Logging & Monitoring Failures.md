# Security Logging & Monitoring Failures

Security logging and monitoring failures occur when an application or system **fails to properly collect, analyze, or respond to security events**, allowing attackers to operate undetected. These failures hinder **incident detection, forensic analysis, and breach response**, increasing the risk of prolonged attacks, data breaches, and compliance violations.

When web applications are set up, every action performed by the user should be logged. Logging is important because, in the event of an incident, the attackers' activities can be traced. Once their actions are traced, their risk and impact can be determined. Without logging, there would be no way to tell what actions were performed by an attacker if they gain access to particular web applications. The more significant impacts of these include:

- **Regulatory damage:** if an attacker has gained access to personally identifiable user information and there is no record of this, final users are affected, and the application owners may be subject to fines or more severe actions depending on regulations.
- **Risk of further attacks:** an attacker's presence may be undetected without logging. This could allow an attacker to launch further attacks against web application owners by stealing credentials, attacking infrastructure and more.

The information stored in logs should include the following:

- <span style="color: inherit;">HTTP</span> status codes
- Time Stamps
- Usernames
- <span style="color: inherit;">API</span> endpoints/page locations
- IP addresses

These logs have some sensitive information, so it's important to ensure that they are stored securely and that multiple copies of these logs are stored at different locations.

### Why Are Logging and Monitoring Important?

1.  **Detects Security Incidents** – Effective logging helps identify **brute-force attacks, malware infections, unauthorized access, and privilege escalation**.
2.  **Enables Incident Response** – Without proper logs, security teams **cannot investigate or respond to attacks effectively**.
3.  **Meets Compliance Requirements** – Many regulations (**PCI DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001**) mandate security logging.
4.  **Reduces Dwell Time** – Logging and monitoring help detect threats early, minimizing **the time an attacker remains inside a system**.

As you may have noticed, logging is more important after a breach or incident has occurred. The ideal case is to have monitoring in place to detect any suspicious activity. The aim of detecting this suspicious activity is to either stop the attacker completely or reduce the impact they've made if their presence has been detected much later than anticipated. Common examples of suspicious activity include:

- Multiple unauthorized attempts for a particular action (usually authentication attempts or access to unauthorized resources, e.g. admin pages)
- Requests from anomalous IP addresses or locations: while this can indicate that someone else is trying to access a particular user's account, it can also have a false positive rate.
- Use of automated tools: particular automated tooling can be easily identifiable, e.g. using the value of User-Agent headers or the speed of requests. This can indicate that an attacker is using automated tooling.
- Common payloads: in web applications, it's common for attackers to use known payloads. Detecting the use of these payloads can indicate the presence of someone conducting unauthorized/malicious testing on applications.

Just detecting suspicious activity isn't helpful. This suspicious activity needs to be rated according to the impact level. For example, certain actions will have a higher impact than others. These higher-impact actions need to be responded to sooner; thus, they should raise alarms to get the relevant parties' attention.

## Common Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

### 1\. Lack of Critical Security Logs

- **No logging of authentication events** (e.g., login attempts, failed logins, password changes).
- **No tracking of privileged user actions** (e.g., admin changes, database modifications).
- **No logging of system errors or security warnings**.

**Example:**

- An attacker **brute-forces a login**, but since failed login attempts **are not logged**, the attack goes unnoticed.

**Prevention Measures:**

- Enable **detailed logging for authentication, authorization, and critical system actions**.
- Log **security events such as file access, privilege escalations, and data modifications**.
- Retain logs for an adequate period (e.g., **90–180 days or per compliance requirements**).

* * *

### 2\. Logging Sensitive Information

- Storing **passwords, API keys, or PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in logs**.
- Exposing logs to **unauthorized users** or failing to encrypt log files.

**Example:**

- A misconfigured logging system **records passwords in plaintext**, allowing attackers to steal credentials.

**Prevention Measures:**

- **Mask or redact sensitive data** in logs (e.g., avoid logging full credit card numbers).
- Store logs in **encrypted storage** and restrict access to authorized personnel.
- Use **log anonymization techniques** where necessary.

* * *

### 3\. Failure to Centralize and Correlate Logs

- Logs are stored **in separate locations**, making **correlation of security events difficult**.
- No **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system to **aggregate and analyze logs**.

**Example:**

- A **database breach** occurs, but logs are **spread across multiple servers**, preventing **real-time detection and response**.

**Prevention Measures:**

- Use a **SIEM system (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack, IBM QRadar, Microsoft Sentinel)** to **collect, centralize, and analyze logs**.
- Set up **log forwarding** to a secure and centralized log server.
- Implement **correlation rules** to detect anomalies across different log sources.

* * *

### 4\. No Real-Time Monitoring or Alerting

- Logs are collected but **not actively monitored**.
- No **alerts for suspicious activity**, leading to delayed response.

**Example:**

- An attacker **exfiltrates large amounts of sensitive data**, but **no alerts are triggered** because **data transfer logs are not monitored**.

**Prevention Measures:**

Implement **real-time alerts for critical security events** (e.g., multiple failed logins, large data transfers).  
✔ Use **automated threat detection** tools to identify suspicious behavior.  
✔ Enable **log-based intrusion detection (e.g., OSSEC, Wazuh, Snort)**.

* * *

### **5\. Incomplete or Unstructured Logs**

- Logs **lack timestamps, IP addresses, user IDs, or event descriptions**.
- Events are logged but **inconsistently formatted**, making analysis difficult.

**Example:**

- During a breach investigation, **incomplete logs make it impossible to trace an attacker’s actions**.

**Prevention Measures:**

- Use **structured logging formats** (e.g., JSON, syslog).
- Include **essential metadata (timestamp, user ID, source IP, event details, and response actions)**.
- Standardize logging across all systems to **ensure consistency**.

* * *

### 6\. Logs Are Not Protected from Tampering

- Attackers **delete or modify logs** to cover their tracks.
- Logs are stored **on the same system** they originate from, making them **easy to erase after a compromise**.

**Example:**

- An attacker **gains root access**, disables logging, and **deletes log history**, making forensic investigation impossible.

**Prevention Measures:**

- Store logs in **a separate, tamper-proof system** (e.g., write-once storage, immutable logs).
- Use **log integrity checks (HMAC, digital signatures)** to detect modifications.
- Implement **role-based access controls (RBAC)** to restrict who can access or modify logs.

* * *

### 7\. Ignoring or Overlooking Logged Events

- Logs contain security incidents, but **no action is taken**.
- **Excessive noise in logs** leads to **alert fatigue**, causing real threats to be ignored.

**Example:**

- A company’s firewall logs **show repeated intrusion attempts**, but since security analysts are **overwhelmed by alerts**, no action is taken until a breach occurs.

**Prevention Measures:**

- Implement **alert prioritization** to highlight critical threats.
- Use **machine learning-based anomaly detection** to reduce false positives.
- Automate incident response using **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) tools**.

* * *

## How to Prevent Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

### 4\. Protect Logs from Tampering

- Store logs in a **separate, tamper-proof system** (e.g., SIEM, cloud logging, write-once storage).
- Use **cryptographic integrity checks (HMAC, SHA-256) to detect tampering**.
- Restrict **log access using RBAC** and **least privilege principles**.

### 5\. Improve Incident Response

- Define **clear incident response procedures** based on log analysis.
- Automate **threat detection and response** using **SOAR tools**.
- Train security teams to **analyze logs effectively and respond to alerts**.

## Conclusion

Security logging and monitoring failures significantly **increase the risk of undetected attacks and prolonged breaches**. Organizations must implement **comprehensive logging, centralized log management, real-time monitoring, and strong access controls** to detect and respond to security incidents effectively. Without proper logging and monitoring, security threats can remain unnoticed, leading to **data breaches, compliance violations, and operational disruptions**.
