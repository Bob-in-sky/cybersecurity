# Data Integrity Failures

Data integrity failures occur when data is **altered, corrupted, or deleted** either **intentionally or unintentionally**, leading to **inconsistent, incorrect, or maliciously manipulated information**. These failures compromise the **accuracy, consistency, and reliability** of data, affecting both security and business operations.

### Why Are Data Integrity Failures Dangerous?

1.  **Data Corruption** – Inaccurate or tampered data can **disrupt business processes** and lead to **wrong decisions**.
2.  **Unauthorized Modifications** – Attackers can manipulate **financial transactions, audit logs, or medical records**.
3.  **Loss of Compliance** – Regulations like **GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS** require organizations to maintain **data integrity**.
4.  **Security Breaches** – If **tampered data** is trusted, it can lead to **fraud, unauthorized access, or system compromise**.

Let's think of how web applications maintain sessions. Usually, when a user logs into an application, they will be assigned some sort of session token that will need to be saved on the browser for as long as the session lasts. This token will be repeated on each subsequent request so that the web application knows who we are. These session tokens can come in many forms but are usually assigned via cookies. **Cookies** are key-value pairs that a web application will store on the user's browser and that will be automatically repeated on each request to the website that issued them.

For example, if you were creating a webmail application, you could assign a cookie to each user after logging in that contains their username. In subsequent requests, your browser would always send your username in the cookie so that your web application knows what user is connecting. This would be a terrible idea security-wise because, as we mentioned, cookies are stored on the user's browser, so if the user tampers with the cookie and changes the username, they could potentially impersonate someone else and read their emails! This application would suffer from a data integrity failure, as it trusts data that an attacker can tamper with.

One solution to this is to use some integrity mechanism to guarantee that the cookie hasn't been altered by the user. To avoid re-inventing the wheel, we could use some token implementations that allow you to do this and deal with all of the cryptography to provide proof of integrity without you having to bother with it. One such implementation is **<span style="color: inherit;">JSON</span> Web Tokens (JWT)**.

JWTs are very simple tokens that allow you to store key-value pairs on a token that provides integrity as part of the token. The idea is that you can generate tokens that you can give your users with the certainty that they won't be able to alter the key-value pairs and pass the integrity check. The structure of a JWT token is formed of 3 parts:

The header contains metadata indicating this is a JWT, and the signing algorithm in use is HS256. The payload contains the key-value pairs with the data that the web application wants the client to store. The signature is similar to a hash, taken to verify the payload's integrity. If you change the payload, the web application can verify that the signature won't match the payload and know that you tampered with the JWT. Unlike a simple hash, this signature involves the use of a secret key held by the server only, which means that if you change the payload, you won't be able to generate the matching signature unless you know the secret key.

Notice that each of the 3 parts of the token is simply plaintext encoded with base64. You can use [this online tool](https://appdevtools.com/base64-encoder-decoder) to encode/decode base64. Try decoding the header and payload of the following token:

`eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Imd1ZXN0IiwiZXhwIjoxNjY1MDc2ODM2fQ.C8Z3gJ7wPgVLvEUonaieJWBJBYt5xOph2CpIhlxqdUw`

**Note:** The signature contains binary data, so even if you decode it, you won't be able to make much sense of it anyways.

## JWT and the None Algorithm

A data integrity failure vulnerability was present on some libraries implementing JWTs a while ago. As we have seen, JWT implements a signature to validate the integrity of the payload data. The vulnerable libraries allowed attackers to bypass the signature validation by changing the two following things in a JWT:

1.  Modify the header section of the token so that the `alg` header would contain the value `none`.
2.  Remove the signature part.

Taking the JWT from before as an example, if we wanted to change the payload so that the username becomes "admin" and no signature check is done, we would have to decode the header and payload, modify them as needed, and encode them back. Notice how we removed the signature part but kept the dot at the end.

## Common Causes of Data Integrity Failures

### 1\. Unauthorized Data Modification

- Attackers or **insiders alter data records** without proper authentication.
- **Weak access controls** allow unauthorized changes to sensitive information.
- **Privilege escalation attacks** allow users to modify data they should not have access to.

**Example:**

- An attacker **manipulates financial records** in a banking system to **change account balances**.

**Prevention Measures:**

- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to restrict who can modify data.
- Use **database transaction logging and auditing** to track changes.
- Enforce **multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive actions**.

* * *

### 2\. Data Corruption

- **Hardware failures** (e.g., disk corruption, memory errors) cause **data loss**.
- **Software bugs** lead to **incorrect calculations or inconsistent records**.
- **Unsecured data transmissions** result in altered or lost data.

**Example:**

- A **database server crash** results in **corrupt financial transaction records**, leading to lost or incorrect payments.

**Prevention Measures:**

- Implement **checksums and hash verification (SHA-256, CRC)** to detect corruption.
- Use **database redundancy and backups** to recover lost data.
- Deploy **error-correcting memory (ECC RAM) and RAID storage** to prevent corruption.

* * *

### 3\. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

- Attackers intercept and modify **unencrypted data transmissions**.
- **Lack of TLS encryption** allows attackers to **alter messages between systems**.

**Example:**

- A **hacker intercepts an API request** and **modifies a financial transaction amount** before it reaches the bank server.

**Prevention Measures:**

- Enforce **TLS encryption (TLS 1.2 or higher) for all data transmissions**.
- Use **end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for sensitive communications**.
- Implement **digital signatures to verify message authenticity**.

* * *

### 4\. Weak Database Security

- **No database encryption**, allowing attackers to read and modify stored data.
- **SQL injection attacks** allow unauthorized access and modification of data.
- **Poorly configured cloud databases** expose sensitive data.

**Example:**

- An attacker exploits **SQL injection** to **modify or delete customer records**.

**Prevention Measures:**

- Use **parameterized queries and ORM frameworks** to prevent SQL injection.
- Encrypt **data at rest and in transit** to protect stored information.
- Regularly apply **security patches to database management systems (DBMS)**.

* * *

### 5\. Lack of Data Validation and Integrity Checks

- **Input validation is missing**, allowing **incorrect or malicious data** to enter a system.
- **No referential integrity** between database tables causes **orphan records**.
- **Timestamp tampering** allows unauthorized changes to transaction history.

**Example:**

- A user submits a **negative value for a financial transaction**, causing unexpected system behavior.

**Prevention Measures:**

- Enforce **strong input validation** (e.g., reject negative values where not allowed).
- Implement **referential integrity constraints** (e.g., foreign key checks in databases).
- Use **immutable logs and cryptographic timestamps** to prevent tampering.

* * *

### 6\. Ransomware and Data Tampering

- Ransomware encrypts or corrupts **critical business data**.
- Attackers **modify stored data** to create **false records or disrupt operations**.

**Example:**

- A ransomware attack encrypts **hospital patient records**, making them **unusable** for medical staff.

**Prevention Measures:**

- Implement **real-time backup solutions** and **disaster recovery plans**.
- Use **immutable storage** to prevent unauthorized data modifications.
- Deploy **behavior-based anomaly detection** to identify suspicious data access.

* * *

## How to Prevent Data Integrity Failures
