# Cryptographic Failures

A **cryptographic failure** refers to any vulnerability arising from the misuse (or lack of use) of cryptographic algorithms for protecting sensitive information. Web applications require cryptography to provide confidentiality for their users at many levels.

Cryptographic failures occur when sensitive data is improperly protected using weak or misconfigured cryptographic mechanisms, or when encryption is not used at all. These failures can lead to data exposure, allowing attackers to steal or manipulate confidential information.

Take, for example, a secure email application:

- When you are accessing your email account using your browser, you want to be sure that the communications between you and the server are encrypted. That way, any eavesdropper trying to capture your network packets won't be able to recover the content of your email addresses. When we encrypt the network traffic between the client and server, we usually refer to this as **encrypting data in transit**.
    
- Since your emails are stored in some server managed by your provider, it is also desirable that the email provider can't read their client's emails. To this end, your emails might also be encrypted when stored on the servers. This is referred to as **encrypting data at <span style="color: inherit;">rest</span>**.
    

Cryptographic failures often end up in web apps accidentally divulging sensitive data. This is often data directly linked to customers (e.g. names, dates of birth, financial information), but it could also be more technical information, such as usernames and passwords.

At more complex levels, taking advantage of some cryptographic failures often involves techniques such as "Man in The Middle Attacks", whereby the attacker would force user connections through a device they control. Then, they would take advantage of weak encryption on any transmitted data to access the intercepted information (if the data is even encrypted in the first place). Of course, many examples are much simpler, and vulnerabilities can be found in web apps that can be exploited without advanced networking knowledge. Indeed, in some cases, the sensitive data can be found directly on the web server itself.

## Common Cryptographic Failures

Cryptographic failures arise from various weaknesses, including **insecure encryption, poor key management, and improper implementation of cryptographic protocols**.

### 1\. Storing Sensitive Data Without Encryption

- **Issue:** Storing passwords, credit card details, or personal data in plaintext in a database or log files.
    
- **Risk:** If an attacker gains access to the database, they can steal all user information.
    
- **Example:**
    
    ```makefile
    username: johndoe
    password: MySecret123 ❌ (Stored in plaintext)
    ```
    
- **Fix:** Always encrypt sensitive data using **strong encryption algorithms** such as AES-256.
    

* * *

### 2\. Weak or Outdated Encryption Algorithms

- **Issue:** Using outdated or weak encryption methods like **MD5, SHA-1, or DES**.
- **Risk:** Attackers can **brute-force or decrypt** the data easily.
- **Example:** MD5 hashing is no longer secure because it is vulnerable to **rainbow table attacks**.
- **Fix:** Use **strong, modern algorithms** such as **AES-256 for encryption** and **SHA-256 or bcrypt for hashing**.

✅ **Good example (using bcrypt for password hashing):**

```python
import bcrypt
password = b"SuperSecurePassword!"
hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt())
```

* * *

### 3\. Hardcoded or Exposed Cryptographic Keys

- **Issue:** Storing API keys, encryption keys, or credentials in source code, Git repositories, or configuration files.
    
- **Risk:** If attackers find these keys (e.g., via GitHub leaks), they can decrypt encrypted data or impersonate the application.
    
- **Example:**
    

```python
SECRET_KEY = "MySuperSecretKey123" ❌ (Hardcoded in source code)
```

- **Fix:**
    
    - Use **environment variables** or a secure vault (e.g., **AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault**).
    - Rotate keys regularly.

✅ **Good example (using environment variables):**

```python
import os
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")
```

* * *

### 4\. Improperly Implemented Encryption

- **Issue:** Using encryption incorrectly, such as:
    
    - Using **ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode** (which reveals patterns in the data).
    - Not using **random IVs (Initialization Vectors)**.
    - Using **predictable key generation**.
- **Risk:** Even if encryption is used, attackers can exploit **patterns** or **predictable keys**.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - AES in **ECB mode** exposes patterns in encrypted data.
    - ```python
        from Crypto.Cipher import AES
        cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)  # ❌ ECB mode is insecure
        ```
        
- **Fix:**
    - Use **AES in GCM or CBC mode with a secure IV**.
    - Example of **AES in GCM mode**:
    - ```python
        from Crypto.Cipher import AES
        cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM)
        ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(plaintext)
        ```
        

* * *

### 5\. Failure to Encrypt Data in Transit

- **Issue:** Not using **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** to protect data exchanged between clients and servers.
    
- **Risk:** Data can be intercepted using **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks**.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - ```plaintext
        http://example.com/login  ❌ (No encryption)
        ```
        
- **Fi****x:**
    
    - **Always use HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or 1.3).**
    - Configure **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**.
    - Avoid **weak TLS versions (SSL, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1)**.

✅ **Good example:**

```plaintext
https://example.com/login ✅ (Secure communication)
```

* * *

### 6\. Using Predictable Cryptographic Keys

- **Issue:** Using weak, static, or hardcoded keys.
    
- **Risk:** Attackers can **guess keys** or **brute-force them**.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - Using a simple key:
        
    - ```plaintext
        Key: 1234567890abcdef ❌ (Predictable)
        ```
        
- **Fix:**
    
    - Generate **strong, random keys** using secure libraries.
        
    - Example of **secure key generation in Python:**
        
    - ```python
        import os
        key = os.urandom(32)  # ✅ Generates a strong 256-bit key
        ```
        

* * *

### 8\. Improper Password Storage (No Salting or Weak Hashing)

- **Issue:** Storing user passwords using **MD5, SHA-1, or unsalted hashes**.
    
- **Risk:** Attackers can crack weak hashes using **rainbow tables**.
    
- **Example (Insecure Password Storage using SHA-1)**:
    
    - ```python
        import hashlib
        password = "SuperSecurePassword"
        hash = hashlib.sha1(password.encode()).hexdigest()  # ❌ Weak hashing
        ```
        
- **Fix:**
    
    - Use **bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2** for password hashing.
    - **Always salt passwords** to prevent rainbow table attacks.

✅ **Good example (bcrypt with salting)**:

```python
import bcrypt
password = b"MySecurePassword!"
hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt())
```

## Best Practices for Preventing Cryptographic Failures

### 1\. Always Use Strong Encryption Standards

- Use AES-256 for encryption.
- Use TLS 1.2 or 1.3 for securing communications.
- Use bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 for password hashing.

### 2\. Secure Cryptographic Keys

- Never hardcode or expose keys in source code.
- Use secure key management solutions (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
- Regularly rotate encryption keys.

### 3\. Encrypt Data at Rest and in Transit

- Use full-disk encryption for databases storing sensitive data.
- Enable HTTPS (TLS) for web applications.
- Use strong ciphers and disable weak protocols (TLS 1.0, SSL).

### 4\. Use Secure Random Number Generators

- Do not use `rand()` or `random()` for cryptographic purposes.
- Use `os.urandom()` or cryptographic libraries for randomness.

### 5\. Protect API Keys and Credentials

- Store API keys securely in environment variables or secret vaults.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for key usage.
- Limit API key permissions to the minimum necessary.

### 6\. Use Proper Padding and IVs for Encryption

- Use a random IV (Initialization Vector) for CBC/GCM encryption.
- Never reuse IVs for encryption.
