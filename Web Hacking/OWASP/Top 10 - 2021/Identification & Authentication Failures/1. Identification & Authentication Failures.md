# Identification & Authentication Failures

Authentication and session management constitute core components of modern web applications. Authentication allows users to gain access to web applications by verifying their identities. Identification and authentication failures occur when **applications do not properly validate or secure user identities**, leading to unauthorized access, account takeovers, or data breaches.

The most common form of authentication is using a username and password mechanism. A user would enter these credentials, and the server would verify them. The server would then provide the users' browser with a session cookie if they are correct. A session cookie is needed because web servers use <span style="color: inherit;">HTTP</span>(S) to communicate, which is stateless. Attaching session cookies means the server will know who is sending what data. The server can then keep track of users' actions.

### Why Are These Failures Dangerous?

- **Leads to Account Takeovers** – Attackers can hijack user accounts if authentication is weak.
- **Allows Unauthorized Access** – If identity verification is not enforced properly, attackers can access restricted areas.
- **Enables Brute-Force and Credential Stuffing Attacks** – Weak password policies and missing rate-limiting allow attackers to guess passwords.
- **Compromises API Security** – APIs without proper authentication can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.

If an attacker is able to find flaws in an authentication mechanism, they might successfully gain access to other users' accounts. This would allow the attacker to access sensitive data (depending on the purpose of the application). Some common flaws in authentication mechanisms include the following:

- **Brute force attacks:** If a web application uses usernames and passwords, an attacker can try to launch brute force attacks that allow them to guess the username and passwords using multiple authentication attempts.
- **Use of weak credentials:** Web applications should set strong password policies. If applications allow users to set passwords such as "password1" or common passwords, an attacker can easily guess them and access user accounts.
- **Weak Session Cookies:** Session cookies are how the server keeps track of users. If session cookies contain predictable values, attackers can set their own session cookies and access users' accounts.

There can be various mitigation for broken authentication mechanisms depending on the exact flaw:

- To avoid password-guessing attacks, ensure the application enforces a strong password policy.
- To avoid brute force attacks, ensure that the application enforces an automatic lockout after a certain number of attempts. This would prevent an attacker from launching more brute-force attacks.
- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication. If a user has multiple authentication methods, for example, using a username and password and receiving a code on their mobile device, it would be difficult for an attacker to get both the password and the code to access the account.

## Common Types of Identification and Authentication Failures

### 1\. Weak Password Policies

- Allowing short, simple, or commonly used passwords (`123456`, `password`).
- No enforcement of password complexity (e.g., uppercase, numbers, symbols).
- Not requiring regular password changes in high-risk environments.

**How to Fix:**

- Enforce strong password policies (e.g., **minimum 12 characters, mix of upper/lowercase, numbers, symbols**).
- Use a **password blacklist** to block common weak passwords.
- Implement **password hashing** using **bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2**.

* * *

### 2\. Missing or Weak Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Allowing only password-based authentication without additional security layers.
- Using SMS-based MFA, which is vulnerable to **SIM swapping attacks**.

**How to Fix:**

- Require **MFA for all sensitive actions (e.g., login, password reset, money transfers)**.
- Use **TOTP-based authentication (Google Authenticator, Authy)** or **hardware security keys (YubiKey, FIDO2)**.
- Allow biometric authentication where applicable.

* * *

### 3\. No Account Lockout or Rate Limiting

- Users can attempt **unlimited login attempts**, making brute-force attacks easy.
- APIs allow **credential stuffing attacks** without detection.

**How to Fix:**

- Implement **account lockouts after multiple failed login attempts**.
- Use **progressive delays** (e.g., increase wait time after each failed attempt).
- Enable **rate limiting on APIs** (e.g., allow **5 login attempts per minute**).
- Deploy **bot detection tools** to block automated attacks.

* * *

### 4\. Credential Stuffing Vulnerabilities

- Attackers use leaked username/password combos from previous data breaches to gain access.
- Users **reuse passwords across multiple sites**, making them vulnerable.

**How to Fix:**

- Check **passwords against breached databases** (e.g., use **Have I Been Pwned API**).
- Implement **MFA to reduce the impact of reused passwords**.
- Require **users to reset passwords if compromised credentials are detected**.

* * *

### 5\. Insecure Session Management

- No **session expiration**, allowing attackers to reuse old session tokens.
- **Session IDs stored in URLs**, making them easy to steal via phishing or referrer leaks.
- No **session invalidation on logout**.

**How to Fix:**

- Use **secure, random session tokens (e.g., JWT with proper expiration settings)**.
- Store session IDs in **HTTP-only cookies** (to prevent XSS attacks).
- Expire sessions **after inactivity** (e.g., **15-30 minutes for sensitive actions**).
- Require **re-authentication for critical operations** (e.g., changing account settings).

* * *

### 6\. Improper API Authentication

- APIs allow unauthenticated requests to access or modify data.
- Weak API keys or missing authentication headers.
- Lack of proper **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** implementation.

**How to Fix:**

- Require **token-based authentication (JWT, OAuth 2.0, API keys)**.
- Restrict API access based on **roles and permissions (RBAC)**.
- Implement **rate limiting and IP whitelisting** for sensitive APIs.

* * *

### 7\. Exposed Authentication Data

- Storing **plaintext passwords** in databases or logs.
- Hardcoding API keys or credentials in **source code**.
- Exposing JWT tokens in URLs.

**How to Fix:**

- **Never store passwords in plaintext** – always **hash them with bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2**.  
    
- **Store API keys in secure vaults** (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
- Avoid sending authentication data in **URLs or GET parameters**.

* * *

## How to Prevent Identification and Authentication Failures

### 1\. Implement Strong Authentication Mechanisms

- Use MFA for all critical actions.
- Require strong passwords and prevent reuse of breached credentials.
- Use OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect for API authentication.

### 2\. Secure Session Management

- Expire inactive sessions automatically.
- Invalidate old sessions after logout or password reset.
- Store session tokens securely in cookies (HTTP-only, Secure flag enabled).

### 3\. Implement Robust Security Controls

- Monitor failed login attempts and implement account lockouts.
- Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to block brute-force attempts.
- Regularly audit authentication logs for suspicious activity.

### 4\. Keep Authentication Data Secure

- Hash passwords properly and never store them in plaintext.
- Use secure storage solutions for API keys and credentials.
- Encrypt sensitive authentication data at rest and in transit.

## Conclusion

Identification and authentication failures are one of the most **exploited security risks**, leading to **account takeovers, unauthorized access, and data breaches**. By **enforcing strong authentication**, **securing session management**, and **monitoring authentication attempts**, organizations can **prevent these attacks and protect user data**.
