# Features of Burp Community

Although <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Community offers a more limited feature set compared to the Professional edition, it still provides an impressive array of tools that are highly valuable for web application testing. Let's explore some of the key features:

- **<span style="color: inherit;">Proxy</span>**: The Burp <span style="color: inherit;">Proxy</span> is the most renowned aspect of <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span>. It enables interception and modification of requests and responses while interacting with web applications.
- **Repeater**: Another well-known feature. [Repeater](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiterepeater) allows for capturing, modifying, and resending the same request multiple times. This functionality is particularly useful when crafting payloads through trial and error (e.g., in <span style="color: inherit;">SQLi</span> - Structured Query Language Injection) or testing the functionality of an endpoint for vulnerabilities.
- **Intruder**: Despite rate limitations in <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Community, [Intruder](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteintruder) allows for spraying endpoints with requests. It is commonly utilized for brute-force attacks or fuzzing endpoints.
- **Decoder**: [Decoder](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteom) offers a valuable service for data transformation. It can decode captured information or encode payloads before sending them to the target. While alternative services exist for this purpose, leveraging Decoder within <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> can be highly efficient.
- **Comparer**: As the name suggests, [Comparer](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteom) enables the comparison of two pieces of data at either the word or byte level. While not exclusive to <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span>, the ability to send potentially large data segments directly to a comparison tool with a single keyboard shortcut significantly accelerates the process.
- **Sequencer**: [Sequencer](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteom) is typically employed when assessing the randomness of tokens, such as session cookie values or other supposedly randomly generated data. If the algorithm used for generating these values lacks secure randomness, it can expose avenues for devastating attacks.

Beyond the built-in features, the Java codebase of <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> facilitates the development of extensions to enhance the framework's functionality. These extensions can be written in Java, Python (using the Java Jython interpreter), or Ruby (using the Java JRuby interpreter). The **<span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Extender** module allows for quick and easy loading of extensions into the framework, while the marketplace, known as the **BApp Store**, enables downloading of third-party modules. While certain extensions may require a professional license for integration, there are still a considerable number of extensions available for Burp Community. For instance, the **Logger++** module can extend the built-in logging functionality of <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span>.
