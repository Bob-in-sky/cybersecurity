# Options

Before diving into the Burp <span style="color: inherit;">Proxy</span>, let's explore the available options for configuring <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span>. There are two types of settings: Global settings (also known as User settings) and Project settings.

- **Global Settings**: These settings affect the entire <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> installation and are applied every time you start the application. They provide a baseline configuration for your <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> environment.
    
- **Project Settings**: These settings are specific to the current project and apply only during the session. However, please note that <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Community Edition does not support saving projects, so any project-specific options will be lost when you close Burp.
    
    To access the settings, click on the **Settings** button in the top navigation bar. This will open a separate settings window.

In the Settings window, you will find a menu on the left-hand side. This menu allows you to switch between different types of settings, including:

1.  **Search**: Enables searching for specific settings using keywords.
2.  **Type filter**: Filters the settings for **User** and **Project** options.
    - **User settings**: Shows settings that affect the entire <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> installation.
    - **Project settings**: Displays settings specific to the current project.
3.  **Categories**: Allows selecting settings by category.

It's worth noting that many tools within <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> provide shortcuts to specific categories of settings. For example, the **<span style="color: inherit;">Proxy</span>** module includes a **<span style="color: inherit;">Proxy</span> settings** button that opens the settings window directly to the relevant <span style="color: inherit;">proxy</span> section.
