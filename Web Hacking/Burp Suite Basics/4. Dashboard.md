# Dashboard

Once you launch <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> and accept the terms and conditions, you will be prompted to select a project type. In <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Community, the options are limited, and you can simply click **Next** to proceed.

The next window allows you to choose the configuration for Burp Suite. It is generally recommended to keep the default settings, which are suitable for most situations. Click **Start Burp** to open the main <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> interface.

Upon opening <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> for the first time, you might encounter a screen with training options. It is highly recommended to go through these training materials when you have the time.

If you don't see the training screen (or in subsequent sessions), you will be presented with the Burp Dashboard, which may seem overwhelming at first. However, it will soon become familiar.

The Burp Dashboard is divided into four quadrants, as labelled in counter-clockwise order starting from the top left:

1.  **Tasks**: The Tasks menu allows you to define background tasks that <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> will perform while you use the application. In <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Community, the default “Live Passive Crawl” task, which automatically logs the pages visited, is sufficient for our purposes in this module. <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Professional offers additional features like on-demand scans.
    
2.  **Event log**: The Event log provides information about the actions performed by <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span>, such as starting the <span style="color: inherit;">proxy</span>, as well as details about connections made through Burp.
    
3.  **Issue Activity**: This section is specific to Burp Suite Professional. It displays the vulnerabilities identified by the automated scanner, ranked by severity and filterable based on the certainty of the vulnerability.
    
4.  **Advisory**: The Advisory section provides more detailed information about the identified vulnerabilities, including references and suggested remediations. This information can be exported into a report. In <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Community, this section may not show any vulnerabilities.
