# Introduction

In essence, <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> is a Java-based framework designed to serve as a comprehensive solution for conducting web application penetration testing. It has become the industry standard tool for hands-on security assessments of web and mobile applications, including those that rely on **a**pplication **p**rogramming **i**nterface**s** (APIs).

Simply put, <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> captures and enables manipulation of all the <span style="color: inherit;">HTTP</span>/HTTPS traffic between a browser and a web server. This fundamental capability forms the backbone of the framework. By intercepting requests, users have the flexibility to route them to various components within the <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> framework, which we will explore in upcoming sections. The ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests before they reach the target server or even manipulate responses before they are received by our browser makes <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> an invaluable tool for manual web application testing.

<span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> is available in different editions. For our purposes, we will focus on the **<span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Community Edition**, which is freely accessible for non-commercial use within legal boundaries. However, it's worth noting that <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> also offers Professional and Enterprise editions, which come with advanced features and require licensing:

1.  **<span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Professional** is an unrestricted version of <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Community. It comes with features such as:
    
    - An automated vulnerability scanner.
    - A fuzzer/brute-forcer that isn't rate limited.
    - Saving projects for future use and report generation.
    - A built-in <span style="color: inherit;">API</span> to allow integration with other tools.
    - Unrestricted access to add new extensions for greater functionality.
    - Access to the <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Collaborator (effectively providing a unique request catcher self-hosted or running on a Portswigger-owned server).
    
    In short, <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Professional is a highly potent tool, making it a preferred choice for professionals in the field.
    
2.  **<span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Enterprise**, in contrast to the community and professional editions, is primarily utilized for continuous scanning. It features an automated scanner that periodically scans web applications for vulnerabilities, similar to how tools like Nessus perform automated infrastructure scanning. Unlike the other editions, which allow manual attacks from a local machine, Burp Suite Enterprise resides on a server and constantly scans the target web applications for potential vulnerabilities.

Due to requiring a license for the Professional and Enterprise editions, we will focus on the core feature set provided by the <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> Community Edition.

**Note:** The provided demonstrations utilize <span style="color: inherit;">Burp Suite</span> for Windows.
