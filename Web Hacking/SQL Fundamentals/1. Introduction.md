# Introduction

Cyber security is a broad topic that covers a wide range of subjects, but few of those are as ubiquitous as databases. Whether youâ€™re working on securing a web application, working in a SOC and using a SIEM, configuring user authentication/access control, or using malware analysis/threat detection tools (the list goes on), you will in some way be relying on databases. For example, on the offensive side of security, it can help us better understand SQL vulnerabilities, such as SQL injections, and create queries that help us tamper or retrieve data within a compromised service. On the other hand, on the defensive side, it can help us navigate through databases and find suspicious activity or relevant information; it can also help us better protect a service by implementing restrictions when needed.
