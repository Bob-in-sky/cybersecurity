# Clauses

A clause is a part of a statement that specifies the criteria of the data being manipulated, usually by an initial statement. Clauses can help us define the type of data and how it should be retrieved or sorted.

In previous tasks, we already used some clauses, such as `FROM` that is used to specify the table we are accessing with our statement and `WHERE`, which specifies which records should be used.

This task will focus on other clauses: `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `HAVING`.

## DISTINCT Clause

The `DISTINCT` clause is used to avoid duplicate records when doing a query, returning only unique values.

Let's use a query `SELECT * FROM books` and observe the results below.

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM books;
+----+----------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| id | name                       | published_date | description                                            |
+----+----------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
|  1 | Android Security Internals | 2014-10-14     | An In-Depth Guide to Android's Security Architecture   |
|  2 | Bug Bounty Bootcamp        | 2021-11-16     | The Guide to Finding and Reporting Web Vulnerabilities |
|  3 | Car Hacker's Handbook      | 2016-02-25     | A Guide for the Penetration Tester                     |
|  4 | Designing Secure Software  | 2021-12-21     | A Guide for Developers                                 |
|  5 | Ethical Hacking            | 2021-11-02     | A Hands-on Introduction to Breaking In                 |
|  6 | Ethical Hacking            | 2021-11-02     |                                                        |
+----+----------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The query's output displays all the content of the table **books**, and the record **Ethical Hacking** is displayed twice. Let's perform the query again, but this time, using the `DISTINCT` clause.

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT DISTINCT name FROM books;
+----------------------------+
| name                       |
+----------------------------+
| Android Security Internals |
| Bug Bounty Bootcamp        |
| Car Hacker's Handbook      |
| Designing Secure Software  |
| Ethical Hacking            |
+----------------------------+

5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The output shows that only five rows are returned, and just one instance of the **Ethical Hacking** record is displayed.

## GROUP BY Clause

The `GROUP BY` clause aggregates data from multiple records and **groups** the query results in columns. This can be helpful for aggregating functions.

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT name, COUNT(*)
    FROM books
    GROUP BY name;
+----------------------------+----------+
| name                       | COUNT(*) |
+----------------------------+----------+
| Android Security Internals |        1 |
| Bug Bounty Bootcamp        |        1 |
| Car Hacker's Handbook      |        1 |
| Designing Secure Software  |        1 |
| Ethical Hacking            |        2 |
+----------------------------+----------+

5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

In the example above, the records on the **book** table are regrouped by the result of the `COUNT` function. We already know that **Ethical hacking** is listed twice, so the total **count** is 2, placed at the end since it is **grouped** **by** count.

## ORDER BY Clause

The `ORDER BY` clause can be used to sort the records returned by a query in ascending or descending order. Using functions like `ASC` and `DESC` can help us to accomplish that, as shown below in the next two examples.

### ascending order

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT *
    FROM books
    ORDER BY published_date ASC;
+----+----------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| id | name                       | published_date | description                                            |
+----+----------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
|  1 | Android Security Internals | 2014-10-14     | An In-Depth Guide to Android's Security Architecture   |
|  3 | Car Hacker's Handbook      | 2016-02-25     | A Guide for the Penetration Tester                     |
|  5 | Ethical Hacking            | 2021-11-02     | A Hands-on Introduction to Breaking In                 |
|  6 | Ethical Hacking            | 2021-11-02     |                                                        |
|  2 | Bug Bounty Bootcamp        | 2021-11-16     | The Guide to Finding and Reporting Web Vulnerabilities |
|  4 | Designing Secure Software  | 2021-12-21     | A Guide for Developers                                 |
+----+----------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### descending order

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT *
    FROM books
    ORDER BY published_date DESC;
+----+----------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| id | name                       | published_date | description                                            |
+----+----------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
|  4 | Designing Secure Software  | 2021-12-21     | A Guide for Developers                                 |
|  2 | Bug Bounty Bootcamp        | 2021-11-16     | The Guide to Finding and Reporting Web Vulnerabilities |
|  5 | Ethical Hacking            | 2021-11-02     | A Hands-on Introduction to Breaking In                 |
|  6 | Ethical Hacking            | 2021-11-02     |                                                        |
|  3 | Car Hacker's Handbook      | 2016-02-25     | A Guide for the Penetration Tester                     |
|  1 | Android Security Internals | 2014-10-14     | An In-Depth Guide to Android's Security Architecture   |
+----+----------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

We can observe the difference when sorting by ascending order using `ASC` and in descending order using `DESC`, both using the **published_date** as reference.

## HAVING Clause

The `HAVING` clause is used with other clauses to filter groups or results of records based on a condition. In the case of `GROUP BY`, it evaluates the condition to `TRUE` or `FALSE`, unlike the `WHERE` clause `HAVING` filters the results after the aggregation is performed.

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT name, COUNT(*)
    FROM books
    GROUP BY name
    HAVING name LIKE '%Hack%';
+-----------------------+----------+
| name                  | COUNT(*) |
+-----------------------+----------+
| Car Hacker's Handbook |        1 |
| Ethical Hacking       |        2 |
+-----------------------+----------+

2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

In the example above, we can observe that the query returns the books with the names that contain the word **hack** and the proper count, as we learned before.
