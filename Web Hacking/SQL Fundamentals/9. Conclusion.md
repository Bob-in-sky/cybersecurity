# Conclusion

This module has hopefully taught you the importance of databases in computing; with so many use cases (which we frequently interact with in our day-to-day lives), learning the fundamentals is a must if you want to pursue a career in cyber security. To round things off, letâ€™s summarise everything that was covered in this room:

- **Databases** are collections of organised data or information that are easily accessible and can be manipulated or analysed.
- The two primary types of databases are **relational databases** (used to store structured data) and **non-relational databases** (used to store data in a non-tabular format).
- Relational databases are made up of **Tables, columns and rows**. **Primary keys** can ensure a record is unique within a table, and **foreign keys** can allow for a relationship/connection to be made between two (or more) tables.
- **<span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span>** is an easy-to-learn programming language that can be used to interact with relational databases.
- **Database and Table statements** can be used to create/manipulate databases and tables.
- CRUD Operations (**INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE** and **DELETE**) can be used to manage data in a database.
- In <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span>, we can use **clauses** to define how data should be retrieved, filtered, sorted, or grouped.
- The efficient use of **operators** and **functions** can help us filter and manipulate data in <span style="color: inherit;">SQL</span>.
